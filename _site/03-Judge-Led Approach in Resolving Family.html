<h2 id="6-judicial-case-management">6. Judicial Case Management</h2>

<p><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></p>

<p>(1) The overarching purpose of case management with the Family Justice Courts is to
facilitate the just resolution of disputes according to law as inexpensively and as
efficiently as possible with the least acrimony.</p>

<p>(2) The purpose of this Practice Direction is to state the purposes and principles of the Case
Management philosophy within the framework of the Judge-Led Approach in
proceedings.</p>

<p><strong><em>Purposes</em></strong></p>

<p>(3) Parties to a proceeding and their lawyers are required to conduct all proceedings in a
way that is consistent with the overarching purpose and ideology governing Family
Justice Courts proceedings.</p>

<p><strong><em>Principles</em></strong></p>

<p>(4) In giving effect to the overarching purpose, the Court, the parties and the parties’
lawyers will necessarily have regard to how the interests of justice will be served either
generally or in any particular proceeding.</p>

<p><strong><em>Key elements</em></strong></p>

<p>(5) To achieve the principles set out in paragraph (4), the parties and the parties’ lawyers
may expect that each case commenced in the Family Justice Courts may be placed in
different tracks bearing in mind the main issues of the case. Possible tracks assigned
are;</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) Child track in which the main issues relate to custody, care and control and
access
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) International track in which the main issues may involve abduction of a child,
relocation issues and issues of appropriate jurisdiction
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) High conflict track in which the main issues are financial and the ascertainment
of value and extent of the matrimonial assets amenable for division
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(d) Violence track in which the issue is one of physical and mental abuse.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(6) A case may be assigned to one or more tracks.</p>

<p>(7) Each case will be allocated to a Judge (assigned Judge) who is then responsible for
managing the case until final disposition.</p>

<p>(8) The assigned Judge will make orders about the way in which the case should be
managed or prepared for hearing including referrals to mediation or other modes of
alternative dispute resolution.</p>

<p>(9) The parties and the parties’ lawyers may expect the assigned Judge to have regard to:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) identifying and narrowing the issues in dispute as early as possible;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) ascertaining the degree of difficulty or complexity of the issues determined to
be in dispute;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) setting a hearing date early;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(d) minimising unnecessary interlocutory steps by permitting only interlocutory
steps that are directed to identifying, narrowing or resolving the issues really in
dispute between the parties; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(e) exploring options for alternative dispute resolution as early as practicable.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(10) The parties and their lawyers are obliged to cooperate with, and assist, the Court in
achieving the overarching purpose and, in particular, in identifying the real issues in
dispute as early as possible and in dealing with those issues efficiently.</p>

<p><strong><em>Interlocutory applications</em></strong></p>

<p>(11) Where parties have included a claim for an interim relief, that claim may be heard on
the return date fixed by the assigned Judge or a date for its later hearing may be set on
the return date and directions for preparations made.</p>

<p>(12) If a claim for interlocutory relief is to be contested, parties or their lawyers should
advise the assigned Judge as soon as possible and to give an estimate of the likely
hearing time.</p>

<p>(13) Parties wishing to make urgent applications should contact the Court and to inform of
urgency to be placed before the assigned Judge</p>

<p>(14) If a claim is made for discovery/interrogatories, parties and lawyers should expect that,
with a view to eliminating or reducing the burden of discovery, the assigned Judge:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) will not order discovery as a matter of course, even where the parties consent,
unless discovery is necessary for the determination of issues in the proceeding;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) will fashion any order for discovery to suit the issues in a particular case; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) will expect the following questions to be answered:
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(i) Is discovery necessary to facilitate the just resolution of the proceeding
as quickly, inexpensively and efficiently as possible?
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(ii) If discovery is necessary, for what purpose?
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(iii) Can those purposes be achieved —
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(A) by a means less expensive than discovery?
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(B) by discovery only in relation to particular issues?
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(iv) Where there are many documents, should discovery be given in a non-
standard form, e.g. initially on a limited basis, with liberty to apply later
for particular discovery or discovery on a broader basis?
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(v) Whether discovery should be given by the use of categories or by
electronic format or in accordance with a discovery plan?
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(vi) Should discovery be given in the list of documents by categories and by
a general description rather than by identification of individual
documents?
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(15) In determining whether to make any order for discovery, the Court will have regard to
the issues in the case and the order in which they are likely to be resolved, the resources
and circumstances of the parties, the likely benefit of discovery and the likely cost of
discovery and whether that cost is proportionate to the nature and complexity of the
proceeding.</p>

<p><strong><em>Case conferences</em></strong></p>

<p>(16) Case conferences will as needed be set to monitor progress in preparation, resolve
emerging procedural and other issues and to make any necessary directions or orders.</p>

<p><strong><em>Communications with Court</em></strong></p>

<p>(17) It is never appropriate to contact the assigned Judge directly. The assigned Judge will
inform parties and their lawyers of preferred modes of communication but in all cases,
the general approach is through emails to the generic email address of the Family Justice
Courts.</p>

<p>(18) All communications with Court should be confined to routine procedural,
administrative or procedural matters. Communications should never, unless this is
invited, contain information or allegations which are material to the substantive issues
in the litigation or which are intended to influence any decision of substance to be made
by the assigned Judge.</p>

<h2 id="7-guidance-on-direct-judicial-communications-in-international-family-proceedings-affecting-children">7. Guidance on Direct Judicial Communications in International Family Proceedings Affecting Children</h2>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Explanatory Note
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Singapore society has become increasingly international. In cases involving children, a
further complication arises where parents and children reside in more than one jurisdiction In
such cases, direct judicial communications may be beneficial. This Practice Direction is issued
to facilitate such communications..
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Direct judicial communications refer to communications that take place between sitting judges
of different jurisdictions when there are concurrent related proceedings involving the same
parties.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>It has now been recognised and firmly established in some foreign jurisdictions such as
England &amp; Wales, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and United States of America that direct
judicial communications are key mechanisms to assist practitioners and judges in resolving
cases with an international element in the best interests of children and of justice in general.
These communications will often result in considerable time savings and better use of
available resources, and are done with the overriding objectiv e of securing the best interests
of the child. Direct judicial communication does not aim to inhibit parties’ right to adduce
expert evidence on the foreign law, but should be seen as another tool to be made available
for parties involved in multiple proceedings in different jurisdictions.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></p>

<p>(1) This Practice Direction is issued to assist judges and practitioners dealing with family
proceedings affecting children in which direct judicial communications may be
beneficial. It is not intended to change the current rules or procedure or to affect the
substantive rights of the parties, but is simply intended to facilitate cooperation in
international cases, where appropriate.</p>

<p>(2) The Liaison Judges of Singapore are appointed by the Chief Justice, and it is part of
their role to receive and, when necessary, channel incoming judicial communications
and initiate or facilitate outgoing communications. The current appointees are set out in
the Annex to this Paragraph (please see below).</p>

<p>(3) Matters which may be the subject of direct judicial communications include, for
example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) scheduling the case in the foreign jurisdiction:
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(i) to make interim orders, eg, support, measure of protection;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(ii) to ensure the availability of expedited hearings;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) establishing whether protective measures are available for the child or other
parent in the jurisdiction to which the child would be returned in the case of a
child abduction case and, in an appropriate case, ensuring the available
protective measures are in place in that jurisdiction before a return is ordered;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) ascertaining whether the foreign court can accept and enforce undertakings
offered by the parties in the initiating jurisdiction;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(d) ascertaining whether the foreign court can issue a mirror order (ie, same order
in both jurisdictions);
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(e) confirming whether orders were made by the foreign court;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(f) verifying whether findings about domestic violence were made by the foreign
court;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(g) verifying whether a transfer of jurisdiction is appropriate.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(4) “Central Authority” in this Practice Direction is the Authority appointed under section
5 of the International Child Abduction Act (Cap 143C).</p>

<p>(5) For the avoidance of doubt, all references to “parties” or their “representatives” shall,
where a child is to be separately represented, include the Child Representative as
appointed by the Court under the Family Justice Rules.</p>

<p><strong><em>Overarching Principles</em></strong></p>

<p>(6) Every judge engaging in direct judicial communications must respect the law of his or
her jurisdiction.</p>

<p>(7) When communicating, each judge seised of the matter should maintain his or her
independence in reaching his or her own decision on the matter at issue.</p>

<p>(8) Communications must not compromise the independence of the judge seised in
reaching his or her own decision on the matter at issue. Any discussion about the merits
of the case should be avoided.</p>

<p>(9) For the avoidance of doubt, parties remain entitled under the <em>Rules of Court</em> to call upon
expert witnesses to prove or disprove the foreign law. The Court will take into account
all the available evidence before arriving at a decision.</p>

<p><strong><em>Procedure and Safeguards</em></strong></p>

<p>(10) Either party to the proceeding may raise with the judge the desirability and need for
direct judicial communications.</p>

<p>(11) A judge seised of the matter may, if he or she determines it desirable, initiate direct
judicial communication through the Liaison Judges.</p>

<p>(12) Before deciding whether to engage in direct judicial communications, the judge should
consider:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) whether there is a question of foreign law or procedure to clarify with a judge
in the foreign jurisdiction,
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) whether the question can be answered or dealt with by the Central Authority in
Singapore or the Central Authority in the foreign jurisdiction, and if so, the
judge may consider having the Central Authority address the issue or obtain the
information, and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) whether the question can be answered or dealt with by any judge in the foreign
jurisdiction (other than the judge hearing the proceeding).
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(13) The following are commonly accepted procedural safeguards.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) Except in special circumstances, parties are to be notified of the nature of the
proposed communication;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) A record is to be kept of communications and it is to be made available to the
parties;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) Any conclusions reached between the judges should be in writing and made
available to parties;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(d) Parties or their representatives should have the opportunity to be present in
certain cases, for example via conference call facilities.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(14) The above commonly accepted procedural safeguards should be adopted subject to
Singapore’s legislation and rules.</p>

<p>(15) In special or urgent circumstances where parties were not notified in advance of the
nature of the proposed communications, the judge should provide written reasons to the
parties as to why there was no notification as soon as practicable.</p>

<p>(16) If any party objects to the proposed communications, the judge should direct
submissions be lodged from all parties, and if necessary, should direct an oral hearing,
before ruling on the matter, giving short reasons for such ruling.</p>

<p><strong><em>Initiating the Communication</em></strong></p>

<p>(17) In considering whether the use of direct judicial communications is appropriate, the
judge should have regard to speed, efficiency and cost-effectiveness.</p>

<p>(18) Judges should consider the benefit of direct judicial communications and at what stage
of the proceeding it should occur. The timing of the communication is for the judge
who initiates it to consider.</p>

<p>(19) The initial communication should ordinarily take place between our Liaison Judge and
the Liaison Judge of the other jurisdiction, if any, in order to ascertain the identity of
the judge seised in that jurisdiction. If no Liaison Judge has been appointed in the other
jurisdiction, the Central Authority of Singapore or the party within jurisdiction is to
assist in providing the identity of the judge in the other jurisdiction.</p>

<p>(20) When making contact with a judge in another jurisdiction, the initial communication
should normally be in writing sent to the email address in the Annex below, subject to
provisions set out in this Practice Direction in relation to written communications, and
should in particular identify:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) the name and contact details of the initiating judge;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) the nature of the case (with due regard to confidentiality concerns);
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) the issue(s) on which communication is sought;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(d) whether the parties before the judge initiating the communication have
consented to judicial communication;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(e) when the communication may occur (with due regard to time differences);
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(f) any specific questions which the judge initiating the communication would like
answered;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(g) any other pertinent matters.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(21) The time and place for communications between the courts should be to the satisfaction
of both courts.</p>

<p>(22) Personnel other than judges in each court may communicate fully with each other to
establish appropriate arrangements for the communication without the necessity for
participation of counsel unless otherwise directed by either of the courts.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Form of Communications and Language Difficulties</em></strong></p>

<p>(23) Judges should use the most appropriate technological facilities in order to communicate
as efficiently and as swiftly as possible.</p>

<p>(24) The initial method and language of communication should, as far as possible, respect
the preferences, if any, indicated by the intended recipient in the list of members of the
Liaison Judges. Further communications should be carried out using the initial method
and language of communication unless otherwise agreed by the judges concerned.</p>

<p>(25) Where two judges do not understand a common language, and translation or
interpretation services are required, such services could be provided by the court or the
Central Authority in the country from which the communication is initiated.</p>

<p><strong><em>Written Communications</em></strong></p>

<p>(26) Written communications, particularly in initiating the contact, are valuable as they
provide for a record of the communication and help alleviate language and time zone
barriers.</p>

<p>(27) Where the written communication is provided through translation, it is good practice
also to provide the message in its original language.</p>

<p>(28) Communications should always include the name, title and contact details of the sender.</p>

<p>(29) Communications should be written in simple terms, taking into account the language
skills of the recipient.</p>

<p>(30) As far as possible, appropriate measures should be taken for the personal information
of the parties to be kept confidential.</p>

<p>(31) Written communications should be transmitted using the most rapid and efficient means
of communication and, in those cases where it is necessary for confidential data to be
transmitted, secured means of communication should be employed.</p>

<p>(32) Written communications should always be acknowledged as soon as possible with an
indication as to when a response will be provided.</p>

<p>(33) All communications should be typewritten.</p>

<p>(34) Ordinarily, communications should be in writing, save where the paragraph (35)
applies.</p>

<p><strong><em>Oral Communications</em></strong></p>

<p>(35) Oral communications are encouraged where judges involved come from jurisdictions
which share the same language.</p>

<p>(36) Where the judges do not speak the same language, one or both of them, subject to an
agreement between the two judges concerned, should have at their disposal a competent
and neutral interpreter who can interpret to and from their language.</p>

<p>(37) Where necessary, personal information concerning the parties should be anonymised
for the purpose of oral communication.</p>

<p>(38) Oral communications can take place by either telephone or video conference and in
those cases where it is necessary that they deal with confidential information, such
communications should be carried out using secured means of communication.</p>

<p>(39) If both judges involved in the communication agree, the parties or their representative
may be permitted to be present during the oral communication. If one party or
representative is to be present, then the other party or representative should be permitted
to be present.</p>

<p>(40) Subject to the agreement of both judges involved in the oral communications-</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) such oral communications may be conducted in the presence of the parties or
their representatives by way of video conference or by conference telephone
call;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) the parties or their representatives may be permitted to speak during the
communication, but if one party or representative wishes to speak, then the other
party or representative should be permitted a chance to answer.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><strong><em>Post Communications</em></strong></p>

<p>(41) A written record of the communications should be sent to the parties as soon as
practicable.</p>

<p>(42) Any correspondence or email or written communications between the judges should be
preserved for the record.</p>

<p><strong><em>Keeping Central Authority informed of judicial communications</em></strong></p>

<p>(43) Where appropriate, the judge engaged in direct judicial communications may consider
informing his or her Central Authority that a judicial communication will take place.</p>

<h2 id="72-originating-summonses">72. Originating Summonses</h2>

<p>(1) This paragraph applies to originating summonses filed on or after 1 January 2006.</p>

<p><strong><em>Forms for originating summonses</em></strong></p>

<p>(2) Solicitors’ attention is drawn to rule 327 of the Family Justice Rules which provides
that no appearance need be entered to an originating summons.</p>

<p>(3) Where any legislation requires a party to file an originating summons and the form is
not provided within the legislation, the originating summons must be filed using either
Form 47 (Originating Summons) or Form 48 ( <em>Ex Parte</em> Originating Summons) of
Appendix A of these Practice Directions.</p>

<p>(4) The parties in Form 47 of Appendix A of these Practice Directions shall be stated as
“plaintiff” and “defendant”, or “appellant” and “respondent” as the case may be.</p>

<p>(5) The party in Form 48 of Appendix A of these Practice Directions shall be stated as
“applicant”.</p>

<p><strong><em>Originating summons to be heard in open Court</em></strong>
(6) Rule 506 of the Family Justice Rules provides that all originating summonses shall be
heard in Chambers, subject to any provisions in the Family Justice Rules, written law,
directions by the Court, or practice directions issued by the Registrar.</p>

<p>(7) In addition to any provisions in the Family Justice Rules or other written law, and
subject to any further directions made by the Court, the Registrar hereby directs that the
following applications made by originating summonses shall be heard in open Court:
(a) applications by the Public Trustee or any person interested in a property to
appoint a receiver of property pending the grant of probate or letters of
administration under section 39 of the Probate and Administration Act (Cap.
251).</p>

<h2 id="73-endorsements-on-originating-processes-and-other-documents">73. Endorsements on originating processes and other documents</h2>

<p>(1) Where it is necessary to include endorsements on any document, the directions in this
paragraph shall apply.</p>

<p>(2) Endorsements are normally made on originating processes and other documents to
show the renewal of, amendments to, and authorisation for service of, the document in
question. Such endorsements on originating processes and other documents do not
require the Registrar’s signature. This is because such endorsements are pursuant to
either an order of Court or the Family Justice Rules. The Registrar should therefore not
be asked to sign such endorsements.</p>

<p>(3) For documents that are filed through the Electronic Filing Service as electronic forms
composed online, the following requirements apply:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) Solicitors should select the appropriate endorsement and check the accuracy of
the electronic form in the preview stage before filing the originating process or
other document. The acceptance by the Registry of electronic forms composed
online does not affect the regularity of any endorsements on the document.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) Where endorsements can be made prior to the filing or issuance of a document,
those endorsements shall be incorporated into the document before the
document is filed or issued.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) Where endorsements must be made on a document which has already been filed
or issued, a fresh copy of the document containing the relevant endorsements
shall be prepared, and the document must be re-filed or re-issued, as the case
may be. An example of this would be renewals of writs of summons.
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="74-forms-of-documents-to-be-filed-for-proceedings-under-chapter-4a-of-part-x-of-the-womens-charter-cap-353">74. Forms of documents to be filed for proceedings under Chapter 4A of Part X of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353)</h2>

<p>(1) An originating summons for leave under section 121D of the Women’s Charter and rule
40 of the Family Justice Rules to file an application for financial relief under section
121B of the Women’s Charter shall be in Form 227 in Appendix A to these Practice
Directions.</p>

<p>(2) The plaintiff’s affidavit in support of the originating summons for leave under section
121D of the Women’s Charter and rule 40 of the Family Justice Rules to file an
application for financial relief under section 121B of the Women’s Charter shall be in
Form 228 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions.</p>

<p>(3) The plaintiff’s affidavit in support of the originating summons for financial relief under
section 121B of the Women’s Charter shall be in Form 229 in Appendix A to these
Practice Directions.</p>

<h2 id="75-distribution-of-applications">75. Distribution of applications</h2>

<p>All applications in chambers (including summonses and originating summonses) shall be filed
without specifying whether the application is to be heard before a Judge in person or the
Registrar.</p>

<h2 id="76-summonses">76. Summonses</h2>

<p>(1) All interlocutory applications must be made by way of summons.</p>

<p>(2) Ordinary summonses shall be endorsed “ <em>ex parte</em> ” or “by consent” where applicable
and when endorsed “ex parte” must bear a certificate to that effect signed by the
solicitors for the applicant.</p>

<p>(3) After the filing of any “ <em>ex parte</em> ” or “by consent” summons, the application will be
examined by the Judge or Registrar as the case may be. If he is satisfied that the
application is in order and all other requirements have been complied with, he may
make the order(s) applied for on the day fixed for the hearing of the application without
the attendance of the applicant or his solicitor.</p>

<p>(4) Summonses that are filed using the Electronic Filing Service will be routed to the inbox
of the applicant solicitor’s Electronic Filing Service account. Where the summons is
filed through the service bureau, it may be collected at the service bureau.</p>

<p>(5) Enquiries by telephone will not be entertained.</p>

<p>(6) Where a summons is filed in a matter for which a trial date has been fixed, the summons
must be filed using the Electronic Filing Service with a special request informing the
Registry of Family Justice Courts of the trial date(s).</p>

<h2 id="77-supporting-affidavits-for-specific-applications">77. Supporting Affidavits for Specific Applications</h2>

<p><strong>Originating Summons for leave to file Writ under section 94 of the Women’s Charter</strong></p>

<p><strong>Summons for leave to file additional Ancillary Matters Affidavits</strong>

shall be made by way of summons filed in the divorce suit, and supported with an
affidavit demonstrating why a reply to the last round of affidavits is relevant and
necessary to the resolution of the ancillary matters.</p>

<p>(3) The summons shall set out:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) The title and date of the affidavit to which the applicant wishes to respond; and

new matters raised; and
(c) the reasons why the applicant’s response would be relevant and material for the
just disposition of the case.</p>

<p><strong>Summons to vary child-related orders</strong>
(6) An application to vary child-related orders shall be made by way of summons filed in
the suit in which the original order was made.</p>

<p>(9) The applicant must file an affidavit that includes the matters set out in sub-paragraphs

<p><strong>Summons to vary maintenance orders made under Part X of Women’s Charter</strong>
(10) Any application for variation of maintenance shall be by way of summons filed in the
original suit under which the order was made.</p>

<p>(11) The summons shall set out :</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) the date of the Order of Court sought to be varied, including the specific
Paragraph(s) in the said Order of Court;

</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(12) The affidavit in support of the summons shall include the following :
(a) The grounds on why a variation of maintenance is sought, including supporting
documentary evidence (e.g. if a variation of maintenance is sought because of
the termination of the applicant’s employment, the letter of termination should

including supporting documentary evidence;
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="78-personal-service-of-processes-and-documents">78. Personal service of processes and documents</h2>

<p>(1) The attention of solicitors is drawn to rule 898(1) of the Family Justice Rules which
provides:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>“Personal service must be effected by a process server of the Court or by a solicitor or
a solicitor's clerk whose name and particulars have been notified in the relevant Form
to the Registrar for this purpose .” [ emphasis added ]
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(2) Solicitors are required to notify the Registry of the particulars, and any change thereof,
of such clerks who have been authorised by them to serve processes and documents
(“authorised process servers”) by submitting a request to authorise user through the
Electronic Filing Service. Where such authorised process servers are no longer so
authorised, solicitors are to revoke or delete the authorisation immediately by
submitting a request through the Electronic Filing Service. Solicitors’ clerks do not
require the authorisation of the Registrar to effect personal service of processes and
documents.</p>

<p>(3) In view of the alternative modes providing for personal service to be effected by a
solicitor or a solicitor’s clerk, Court process servers will not be assigned to effect
personal service of processes and documents unless there are special reasons.</p>

<p>(4) If it is felt that there are special reasons requiring personal service by a Court process
server, a Request for such service should be filed through the Electronic Filing Service,
setting out the special reasons. The approval of the Duty Registrar should then be
obtained for such service. Once approval has been obtained, the documents for service
should be presented at the counter designated for this purpose. A process server will
then be assigned to effect service and an appointment for service convenient to both the
litigant and the assigned process server will be given.</p>

<p>(5) On the appointed date, the person accompanying the process server should call at the
Registry. The amount required for the transport charges of the process server (a record
of which will be kept) should be tendered, or, alternatively, the process server in
question should be informed that transport for him will be provided. The Registry will
then instruct the process server to effect service.</p>

<p>(6) Under no circumstances should any payment be made directly to the process server.</p>

<h2 id="79-substituted-and-dispensation-of-service">79. Substituted and Dispensation of Service</h2>

<p>(1) In any application for substituted service, the applicant should persuade the Court that the
proposed mode of substituted service will bring the document in question to the notice of
the person to be served.</p>

<p><strong>Application for substituted service by way of posting on the front door at the defendant’s
last known address in Singapore (“the address”)</strong></p>

<p>(2) The applicant should, where appropriate, consider other modes of substituted service, such
as AR registered post or electronic means (including electronic mail or Internet
transmission) in addition to or in substitution of substituted service by posting on doors or
gates of residential and business premises.</p>

<p>(3) Two reasonable attempts at personal service should be made before an application for an
order for substituted service is filed. In an application for substituted service, the applicant
shall file a supporting affidavit stating the dates, times and outcomes of the said attempts
and why he or she believes that such attempts made were reasonable.</p>

<p>(4) If there is no response for both attempts at personal service (i.e. the door was locked
and no one came to the door during both attempts), the plaintiff needs to state in the
affidavit —</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) the evidence that the defendant is currently residing at the address (for example,
relevant search results from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, the
Singapore Land Authority, the Housing &amp; Development Board or the
Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority); and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) the grounds for the plaintiff’s belief that the defendant is currently residing at
the address, for example, that the plaintiff is also residing at the same address,
and sees the defendant every day.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(5) If the plaintiff is not able to state both of the matters set out in sub-paragraph (4)(a) and
(b) above in the affidavit, he or she should make attempts to locate the defendant by
contacting the defendant’s relatives, friends, and employer(s) (if any), in order to
discover the address at which the defendant is currently residing. The affidavit should
then include the following matters:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) details of the plaintiff’s last contact with the defendant, including the date, the
mode of contact (i.e. over the telephone, a letter, or a meeting), and the contents
of any communications made, whether written or oral;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) details of the plaintiff’s knowledge of the defendant’s relatives and friends, and
those person(s)’ knowledge of his / her whereabouts (“the defendant’s
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>contacts”), including their names, addresses and their relationship to the
defendant and whether they live in Singapore or overseas;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) details of the plaintiff’s attempts to contact the defendant’s contacts, including
the number of such attempts made, the dates and mode of the said attempts (i.e.
whether by telephone, letter, or meeting), and the contents of any
communications made, whether written or oral;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(d) the name and address of the defendant’s last known employer (if any), and the
result of enquiries the plaintiff has made of that employer as to the defendant’s
whereabouts, including the date of such enquiries, the mode of the said enquiries
(i.e. whether by telephone, letter, or meeting), and the contents of any
communications made, whether written or oral;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(e) details of the defendant’s nationality.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(6) If the local address at which the defendant is currently residing (not being the
matrimonial home) is discovered by the plaintiff pursuant to paragraph (5) above,
personal service on the defendant should be attempted at that address in accordance with
paragraph (3). Details of the dates, times and outcomes of the personal service are
required in the affidavit.</p>

<p>(7) If the response to the attempt at personal service is that the process server is told that
the defendant “is overseas”, evidence is required in the affidavit as to what date the
defendant will be back in the country.</p>

<p>(8) If it appears from the response to the attempt at personal service that the defendant is
permanently overseas, evidence is required in the affidavit as to how the documents will
come to the defendant’s attention by being posted on the front door.</p>

<p>(9) If the response to the attempt at personal service is that the defendant has “moved
away”, and the plaintiff is alleging that the defendant is evading service, evidence is
required in the affidavit to support the plaintiff’s belief that the defendant is evading
service.</p>

<p><strong>Application for substituted service by way of prepaid AR registered post / ordinary post</strong></p>

<p>(10) An application for substituted service need not be made where an originating process is
sent by prepaid AR registered post to the defendant, and the defendant returns the
acknowledgement of service, signed by him, in accordance with rule 48(5) and rule
49(3) of the Family Justice Rules. In such a situation, the originating process would be
deemed to be duly served on the defendant by registered post.</p>

<p>(11) On an application for substituted service by way of prepaid AR registered post / ordinary
post, the plaintiff must state the following matters in the affidavit—</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) the grounds for the plaintiff’s belief that the defendant is currently resident at
the particular address in respect of which the plaintiff is applying for substituted
service by way of prepaid AR registered post / ordinary post;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) if the application for substituted service by way of prepaid AR registered post /
ordinary post is to an overseas address, that the defendant is not ordinarily
resident in Singapore;
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(12) For the avoidance of doubt, substituted service by prepaid AR registered post is deemed
to be effective when the postal service has delivered the document, or attempted to
deliver the document (in cases where no one is present or willing to accept the
document).</p>

<p><strong>Application for substituted service by way of email</strong></p>

<p>(13) If substituted service is by electronic mail, it has to be shown that the electronic mail account
to which the document will be sent belongs to the person to be served and that it is currently
active.</p>

<p><strong>Application for substituted service by way of advertisement</strong></p>

<p>(14) Before an application for substituted service by way of advertisement can be granted,
the plaintiff should make attempts to locate the defendant by contacting the defendant’s
relatives, friends, and employer(s) (if any), in order to discover the address at which the
defendant is currently residing.</p>

<p>(15) The affidavit must include the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) the matters set out in sub-paragraph (5)(a) to (e) above;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) details of the defendant’s literacy, and in what language;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) if the advertisement is to be placed in an overseas newspaper, the grounds for
the plaintiff’s belief as to why the defendant is thought to be in that particular
country.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(16) An application for substituted service by advertisement (in one issue of the Straits Times
if the person to be served is literate in English, or one issue of the Straits Times and one
issue of one of the main non-English language newspapers where his language literacy
is unknown) should only be considered as a last resort and should contain evidence that
the person to be served is literate in the language of the newspaper in which the
advertisement will be placed.</p>

<p><strong>Application for dispensation of service</strong></p>

<p>(17) Before an application for dispensation of service can be granted, the plaintiff should
make attempts to locate the defendant by contacting the defendant’s relatives, friends,
and employer(s) (if any), in order to discover the address at which the defendant is
currently residing.</p>

<p>(18) The affidavit must include the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) the matters set out in sub-paragraph (5)(a) to (e) above;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) an explanation as to why advertisement would not be effective in bringing the
divorce proceedings to the defendant’s notice (for example, that it is not known
which country the defendant is currently residing in).
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(19) For the avoidance of doubt, posting on the Notice Board of the Registry of the Family
Justice Courts is not available as a proposed mode of substituted service.</p>

<h2 id="81-applications-for-electronic-discovery">81. Applications for electronic discovery</h2>

<p>(1) This Part provides an opt-in framework for requests and applications for the giving of
discovery and inspection of electronically stored documents, and the supply of
electronic copies of such documents. A party that seeks to rely on this Part must cite the
relevant paragraph(s) in any request or application made hereunder.</p>

<p><strong><em>Location of electronically stored documents</em></strong></p>

<p>(2) Electronically stored documents may reside in storage management systems, folders or
directories in storage locations, electronic media or recording devices, including folders
or directories where temporarily deleted files are located (for example, the Recycle Bin
folder or Trash folder). Electronically stored documents or parts thereof may also reside
in the unallocated file space or file slack on an electronic medium or recording device
as deleted files or file fragments which may be recovered through the use of computer
forensic tools or techniques.</p>

<p><strong><em>Definition of metadata information</em></strong></p>

<p>(3) Metadata information refers to the non-visible and not readily apparent information
embedded in or associated with electronically stored documents and may include both
application metadata, which is created by the application software used to create the
electronic documents, and system metadata, which is created by the operating or storage
system. Examples of application metadata include hidden columns or text, formatting
and display codes, formulae, prior edits and editorial comments; examples of system
metadata include data relating to creation, modification and access of the electronic
document, its size, file format and storage location, and other document profile
information like title, author, subject and keywords or tags. Metadata information may
be stored internally within the electronically stored document or externally in a separate
file or database. Externally stored metadata information shall be discoverable as
separate documents.</p>

<p><strong><em>Time to consider electronic discovery issues during general discovery</em></strong></p>

<p>(4) Parties are encouraged to collaborate in good faith and agree on issues relating to the
discovery and inspection of electronically stored documents within the framework for
discovery set forth in Part 18 Division 19 of the Family Justice Rules. Such issues may
include the scope and/or any limits on documents to be given in discovery, whether
parties are prepared to make voluntary disclosures, and the giving of discovery in stages
according to an agreed schedule, as well as the format and manner in which copies of
discoverable documents shall be supplied.</p>

<p>(5) Parties may, immediately after the close of pleadings, agree on an electronic discovery
protocol which may take the form set forth in Appendix B Part 1. Parties may include
the agreed electronic discovery protocol in the summons for directions. The Court shall</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>consider the adequacy of the agreed electronic discovery protocol and may make such
order or give such direction as it thinks fit, for the just, expeditious and economical
disposal of the cause or matter. The agreed electronic discovery protocol, as amended
by such order or direction of the Court as the case may be, shall form part of the order
under the summons for directions to be extracted for the action.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(6) If parties are unable to agree on an electronic discovery protocol, the party seeking
discovery of electronically stored documents may apply for an order. The application
must include a draft electronic discovery protocol and must be supported by affidavit
providing an account of the parties’ attempts to collaborate in good faith to reach
agreement on an electronic discovery protocol.</p>

<p><strong><em>Requests for discovery</em></strong></p>

<p>(7) A request for discovery of any electronically stored document or class of electronically
stored documents may be made before the commencement of proceedings, or at any
time to any party to a cause or matter, or any person who is not a party to the
proceedings. Unless the request specifies that discovery of externally stored metadata
information of the requested electronically stored documents is required, the party
providing discovery shall not be required to discover externally stored metadata
information.</p>

<p>(8) A class of electronically stored documents may be described by specifying or describing
a search term or phrase to be used in a reasonable search for electronically stored
documents. A request for the giving of discovery by reasonable search must specify or
describe limits on the scope of the search; such limits shall include at least the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) specifying or describing physical or logical storage locations, media or devices;
and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) specifying the period during which the requested electronically stored
documents were created, received or modified.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(9) A request shall not be made for the discovery of deleted files or file fragments
containing information which may be recovered through the use of computer forensic
tools or techniques unless:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) a request is made for the discovery of the electronic medium or recording device
on which a forensic inspection is to be conducted; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) a request is made for inspection of the said electronic medium or recording
device in compliance with sub-paragraph (21) to (27).
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong><em>Applications for discovery</em></strong></p>

<p>(10) An application for discovery of any electronically stored document or class of
electronically stored documents which includes externally stored metadata information
must be supported by an affidavit showing that a request for externally stored metadata
information of the requested electronically stored document or class of electronically
stored documents had been made previously.</p>

<p>(11) An application for discovery of any electronically stored document or class of
electronically stored documents which specifies or describes a search term or phrase to
be used in a reasonable search for electronically stored documents must specify or
describe limits on the scope of the search to be conducted.</p>

<p>(12) An application for the discovery of a computer database, electronic medium or
recording device may be made together with an application for inspection of the said
computer database, electronic medium or recording device in accordance with sub-
paragraph (21) to (27).</p>

<p>(13) Upon the hearing of an application for an order for discovery of electronically stored
documents, the Court shall have regard to the matters set forth in sub-paragraph (15).</p>

<p>(14) Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the party giving discovery from reviewing the
discoverable electronically stored documents or the results of any reasonable search for
the purpose of identifying privileged documents. However, such review for the purpose
of identifying privileged documents shall not extend to the deletion, removal or
alteration of metadata information.</p>

<p><strong><em>Matters to which regard shall be had in determining whether discovery or inspection is
necessary</em></strong></p>

<p>(15) Rules 468 and 474 of the Family Justice Rules states that an order for discovery and
production of documents for inspection shall not be made unless such order is necessary
either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs. The matters to which
regard shall be had, in determining whether an application for discovery or inspection
(including the supply of copies) of electronically stored documents is necessary either
for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs, shall include:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) the number of electronic documents involved;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) the nature of the case and complexity of the issues;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) the value of the claim and the financial position of each party;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(d) the ease and expense of retrieval of any particular electronically stored document
or class of electronically stored documents, including —
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(i) the accessibility, location and likelihood of locating any relevant
documents,
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(ii) the costs of recovering and giving discovery and inspection of any
relevant documents,
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(iii) the likelihood that any relevant documents will be materially altered in
the course of recovery, or the giving of discovery or inspection; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(e) the significance of any particular electronically stored document or class of
electronically stored documents which are likely to be located to the issues in
dispute.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><strong><em>Form of list</em></strong></p>

<p>(16) The following matters shall be included in any list of documents made pursuant to the
giving of discovery in accordance with this Part in which electronic documents are
enumerated:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) the name of the electronic file constituting or containing the electronic
document; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) the file format (and its version) of the electronic document.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(17) Where the party giving discovery objects to the production of certain discoverable
electronically stored documents solely on the ground that the internally stored metadata
information is protected by privilege, he must state in the list of documents whether he
objects to the production of the electronic documents without the internally stored
metadata information. If he does not object to the production of the electronic
documents without the internally stored metadata information, he must enumerate the
electronic documents in Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the list of documents. In any event, he
must enumerate such documents in a separate section in Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the list
of documents and shall state that he objects to the production of the whole or part of the
internally stored metadata information of these documents.</p>

<p>(18) Reasonable efforts shall be made to remove duplicated documents from the list of
documents. A document shall be considered a duplicate of another if the contents of
both (including metadata information) are identical. The use of a hashing function to
identify duplicates shall be deemed to be reasonable effort.</p>

<p>(19) If copies of electronic documents are supplied in one or more read-only optical disc(s)
or other storage medium, the party giving discovery shall provide a further list, at the
time when such copies are supplied, stating the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) the storage format (and its version) of the optical disc or storage medium; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) if there are multiple optical discs or storage media, a list of electronic documents
stored on each optical disc or storage medium.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(20) An index of documents enumerated in a list of documents referred to in sub-paragraph
(16) or (19) above shall be provided in an electronic, text searchable and structured
format. In the absence of parties’ agreement, this index or load file shall be provided in
a delimited text file in the Comma Separated Value (or ‘CSV’) file format.</p>

<p><strong><em>Inspection of electronically stored documents</em></strong></p>

<p>(21) A party required to produce electronically stored documents for inspection under Part
18 Division 19 of the Family Justice Rules shall provide reasonable means and
assistance for the party entitled to inspection to inspect the electronically stored
documents in their native format.</p>

<p>(22) Where an inspection is carried out under rule 470, 471 or 472(1) of the Family Justice
Rules and the inspecting party wishes to take copies of electronically stored documents
produced for inspection, his request to take copies shall comply with the protocol set
forth in sub-paragraphs (28) to (33).</p>

<p><strong><em>Inspection of computer databases and electronic media or recording devices</em></strong></p>

<p>(23) No request or application for the inspection of any computer database, electronic
medium or recording device shall be made unless discovery of the computer database,
electronic medium or recording device has been given.</p>

<p>(24) A request may be made for the inspection of an electronic medium or recording device
(for which discovery has been given) for the purpose of recovering deleted electronic
documents through the conduct of a forensic examination of the unallocated file space
or file slack of the electronic medium or recording device using computer forensic tools
or techniques.</p>

<p>(25) Where an application under rule 472(2) is made for the inspection of computer
databases, electronic media or recording devices for which discovery has been given,
the party seeking inspection shall include in his application an inspection protocol,
which may take the form found in Appendix B Part 2, in order to ensure that the party
entitled to inspection has access only to electronic documents that are necessary and is
not allowed to trawl through the entire database, electronic media or recording device.</p>

<p>(26) Upon the hearing of an application for an order for the inspection of computer databases,
electronic media or recording devices, the Court shall have regard to the matters set
forth in sub-paragraph (15). The Court shall have the power to review the adequacy of</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>an inspection protocol and may make such order or give such direction as it thinks fit,
for the just, expeditious and economical disposal of the cause or matter.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(27) Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the party producing computer databases,
electronic media or recording devices for inspection from reviewing the discoverable
electronically stored documents or the results of any reasonable search for the purpose
of identifying privileged documents. However, such review for the purpose of
identifying privileged documents shall not extend to the deletion, removal or alteration
of metadata information.</p>

<p><strong><em>Supply of copies of electronically stored documents</em></strong></p>

<p>(28) Copies of discoverable electronically stored documents shall generally be supplied in
the native format in which the requested electronic documents are ordinarily maintained
and in one or more read-only optical disc(s).</p>

<p>(29) Metadata information internally stored in the native format of discoverable
electronically stored documents shall not be deleted, removed or altered without the
agreement of the parties or an order of Court. Where the party giving discovery objects
to the production for inspection of certain discoverable electronically stored documents
solely on the ground that the internally stored metadata information is protected by
privilege, but does not object to the production of the electronic documents without the
internally stored metadata information, copies of such documents may be supplied in a
reasonably usable format with all or such of the metadata information over which
privilege is claimed removed.</p>

<p><strong><em>Requests for the supply of copies</em></strong></p>

<p>(30) A request for copies of discoverable electronically stored documents may specify the
format and manner in which such copies are to be supplied. If the party giving discovery
does not agree with the specified format or manner or both, he may either:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) propose a reasonably usable format and/or storage medium and/or a reasonable
manner in which he intends to supply copies of the requested electronic
documents; or
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) in default of agreement, supply copies of the requested electronic documents in
accordance with sub-paragraph (1).
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(31) The party giving discovery shall not be required to supply copies of electronically stored
documents in more than one format.</p>

<p>(32) The file format versions set forth in Appendix B Part 3 shall be deemed to be reasonably
usable formats for the purpose of this paragraph.</p>

<p><strong><em>Applications for the supply of copies</em></strong></p>

<p>(33) Applications for the supply of copies of discoverable electronically stored documents
shall specify the format and manner in which copies of such electronic documents are
to be supplied.</p>

<p><strong><em>Restriction on use of privileged document, inspection of which has been inadvertently
allowed</em></strong></p>

<p>(34) Rule 479 of the Family Justice Rules applies to the giving of discovery or inspection of
electronically stored documents, including the supply of copies, as it would to the giving
of discovery or inspection of any other document.</p>

<p><strong><em>Costs</em></strong></p>

<p>(35) Except for orders made in respect of third party or pre-action discovery, the costs of
complying with an order for the giving of discovery or inspection of electronically
stored documents shall generally be borne by the party giving discovery; and
disbursements incurred in providing copies shall be reimbursed by the party requesting
for copies.</p>

<p>(36) The Court may invoke its inherent powers under rules 958 and 959 of the Family
Justice Rules to make or give such further orders or directions incidental or
consequential to any order as may be necessary, to order the party entitled to discovery
to bear the whole or a portion of the costs of compliance with such order for the giving
of discovery or inspection of electronically stored documents, and the supply of copies,
if such order is necessary to prevent injustice or to prevent an abuse of the process of
the Court.</p>

<h2 id="82-applications-for-discovery-or-interrogatories-against-network-service-providers">82. Applications for discovery or interrogatories against network service providers</h2>

<p>(1) This Paragraph applies to an application made under rule 467(1) or rule 495(1) of the
Family Justice Rules —</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) by or on behalf of an owner or exclusive licensee of copyright material against

<p>(5) In sub-paragraph (1)(b), the words “electronic recording”, “network service provider”,
“performance” and “primary network” have the same meanings as in section 246(1) of
the Copyright Act (Cap 63).</p>

<h2 id="83-ex-parte-applications-for-injunctions">83. Ex parte applications for injunctions</h2>

<p>(1) Rule 516 of the Family Justice Rules provides that an application for the grant of an
injunction may be made ex parte in cases of urgency. However, the cases of <em>Castle
Fitness Consultancy Pte Ltd v Manz</em> [1989] SLR 896 ‘ <em>The Nagasaki Spirit</em> ’ <em>(No.1)</em>
[1994] 1 SLR 434 take the position that an opponent to an <em>ex parte</em> application,
especially where the application seeks injunctive relief, should be invited to attend at
the hearing of the application.</p>

<p>(2) In view of this, any party applying ex parte for an injunction (including a <em>Mareva</em>
injunction) must give notice of the application to the other concerned parties prior to the
hearing. The notice may be given by way of facsimile transmission or the use of any
other electronic means (including electronic mail or Internet transmission), or, in cases
of extreme urgency, orally by telephone. Except in cases of extreme urgency or with the
leave of the Court, the party shall give a minimum of two hours’ notice to the other
parties before the hearing. The notice should inform the other parties of the date, time
and place fixed for the hearing of the application and of the nature of the relief sought. If
possible, a copy of the originating process, the <em>ex parte</em> summons and supporting
affidavit(s) should be given to each of the other parties in draft form as soon as they are
ready to be filed in Court. At the hearing of the <em>ex parte</em> application, in the event that
some or all of the other parties are not present or represented, the applicant’s solicitors
should inform the Court of:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) the attempts that were made to notify the other parties or their solicitors of the
making of the application;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) what documents were given to the other parties or their solicitors and when these
documents were given; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) whether the other parties or their solicitors consent to the application being heard
without their presence.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(3) The Directions set out in sub-paragraph (2) need not be followed if the giving of the
notice to the other parties, or some of them, would or might defeat the purpose of the <em>ex
parte</em> application. However, in such cases, the reasons for not following the Directions
should be clearly set out in the affidavit prepared in support of the <em>ex parte</em> application.</p>

<h2 id="84-mareva-injunctions">84. Mareva injunctions</h2>

<p>(1) Applicants for <em>Mareva</em> injunctions are required to prepare their orders in accordance
with the following forms in Appendix A:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) Form 239: Worldwide Mareva injunction; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) Form 240: Mareva injunction limited to assets within the jurisdiction.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>When composing the summons electronic form online through the Electronic Filing
Service, these Forms shall be prepared in Portable Document Format (PDF) and
attached to the summons electronic form for an Order of Court in Form 4 or 118 of
Appendix A to these Practice Directions.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(2) These forms, inevitably, are complicated, but their language and layout are intended to
make it easier for persons served with these orders to understand what they
mean. These standard form orders should be used save to the extent that the Judge
hearing a particular application considers there is a good reason for adopting a different
form. Any departure from the terms of the prescribed forms should be justified by the
applicant in his supporting affidavit(s).</p>

<p>(3) The applicant should undertake not to inform any third party of the proceedings until
after the return date.</p>

<p>(4) Wherever practicable, applications should be made sufficiently early so as to ensure that
the Judge has sufficient time to read and consider the application in advance.</p>

<p>(5) On an <em>ex parte</em> application for a <em>Mareva</em> injunction, an applicant may be required, in an
appropriate case, to support his cross-undertaking in damages by a payment to be made
into Court, a bond to be issued by an insurance company with a place of business within
Singapore, a written guarantee to be issued from a bank with a place of business within
Singapore or a payment to the applicant’s solicitor to be held by the solicitor as an
officer of the Court pending further order.</p>

<p>(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, a Family Justice Court may hear any matter in
an open and public court to which the public generally may have access, if the Court is
satisfied that it is expedient in the interests of justice, or for other sufficient reason to do
so. Such matters include but are not limited to:-</p>

bundles of documents, bundles of authorities, bundles of pleadings, bundles of
affidavits, all other bundles, and all opening statements for proceedings which have
been commenced using the Electronic Filing Service must be filed in Court using the
Electronic Filing Service.</p>

<p>(2) In the event that it is not possible to file the documents in advance of the hearing,
counsel may apply to the Judge or Registrar conducting the hearing for leave to use
paper documents during the hearing. The paper documents may be printed on one side
or both sides of each paper. The solicitor must explain why it was not possible to file
the documents in advance of the hearing, and must give an undertaking to file using the
Electronic Filing Service all the documents used at the hearing by the next working day
after the hearing. Any document not filed using the Electronic Filing Service will not
be included in the Court’s case file.</p>

<p>(3) Notwithstanding anything else in this Paragraph, in the event that a party chooses to use
bundles of authorities in paper form for a hearing, the directions in this sub-paragraph
shall apply:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) The party using the paper copy of the bundle of authorities shall bear the onus

<h2 id="89-bundle-of-documents-filed-on-setting-down">89. Bundle of Documents filed on setting down</h2>

<p>(1) Rule 566 of the Family Justice Rules requires a bundle containing certain documents to
be filed together with the notice for setting down. The documents in the bundle should
be included in the order in which these appear in rule 566(1):
<strong>Filing documents when setting down</strong>
(1) The party setting down an action for trial must file with the Registrar a notice for
setting down an action for trial in Form 119 together with a bundle for the use of the
Judge consisting of one copy of each of the following documents:
(a) the writ;
(b) the pleadings (including any affidavits ordered to stand as pleadings), any
notice or order for particulars and the particulars given; and
(c) all orders made on the summons for directions.</p>

<p>(2) In addition, parties should endeavour to file a core bundle of documents. This core
bundle should comprise only documents that are relevant to the hearing in question, or
which will be referred to in the course of the hearing.</p>

<p>(3) These documents must be prepared in an electronic format. If there are other documents,
the relevance of which is uncertain, these documents should be included and any
objections taken before the trial Judge.</p>

<p><strong><em>Directions for electronic creation and filing of bundles of documents</em></strong></p>

<p>(4) The following directions shall apply to the filing of bundles:
(a) Index pages shall be prepared. Bookmarks should be created in the Portable
Document Format (PDF) file for each such reference in the index. There should
be as many book-marks in that PDF file as there are references in the index to
documents in that PDF file.
(b) The name given to each bookmark should be the same as the corresponding
reference in the index.
(c) The various PDF documents should be arranged chronologically or in some
logical order.
(d) The page number of each bundle of documents must correspond to the page
number in the Portable Document Format (PDF) version of that bundle. Each
separate bundle of documents shall start at page 1 and every page shall be
numbered consecutively.</p>

<p>(5) For proceedings using the Electronic Filing Service, a bundle of documents may be
created online and filed through the Electronic Filing Service. The electronic bundle
shall be created in Portable Document Format (PDF). The electronic bundle may
contain:
(a) documents in the electronic case file; and
(b) documents that have been uploaded into the electronic case file by solicitors or
other persons given access to the shared folder in the electronic case file.</p>

<h2 id="90-documents-for-use-in-trials">90. Documents for use in trials</h2>

<p>(1) This Paragraph shall apply to trials of —</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) writ actions; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) originating summonses ordered to be continued as if the cause of action had been
begun by writ.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(2) Rule 567 of the Family Justice Rules requires the originals of the affidavits of the
evidence-in-chief of all witnesses and a bundle of documents to be filed not less than 5
working days before the trial of an action. This Paragraph prescribes the contents and
the format of the bundle of documents. In addition, to improve the conduct of family
proceedings and to reduce the time taken in the presentation of cases in Court, the
following documents shall also be prepared by the respective solicitors of the parties:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) a bundle of authorities; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) an opening statement.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><strong><em>Documents which need not be filed electronically</em></strong></p>

<p>(3) Paragraphs 88, 89(2) to (6) of these Practice Directions do not apply to the documents
that are filed in Court pursuant to the provisions of rule 567(1) of the Family Justice
Rules. Such documents may be tendered to the Registry in hardcopy together with an
electronic copy stored on a CD-ROM in PDF format and complying with the provisions
of this Paragraph.</p>

<p>(4) Any court fees payable, pursuant to Part 19 of the Family Justice Rules, on filing the
documents in this Paragraph, shall be payable at the stamp office. Parties should, when
making payment at the stamp office, indicate to the cashier the precise number of pages
which comprise the documents and comply with the provisions of Paragraph 157 of
these Practice Directions.</p>

<p>(5) It is emphasised that payment of the court fees on such documents should be made
before the documents are tendered to Court in compliance with rule 567 of the Family
Justice Rules. The hardcopy of documents tendered to Court should show, on the front
page, the amount of court fees paid on the document.</p>

<p>(6) The electronic copy must tally in all respects with the hardcopy, as it will be uploaded
into the case file by the Registry staff and will form part of the electronic case file. The
importance of not submitting unnecessarily large electronic files is emphasised. To this
end, parties are to adhere as far as possible to the guidelines set out on the Electronic
Filing Service website (currently at <a href="http://www.elitigation.sg">http://www.elitigation.sg),</a>,) or its equivalent as may be set</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>up from time to time, on the resolution to be used when scanning documents into PDF
format.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(7) In the event that parties elect to electronically file such documents, they must
nevertheless tender a bundle of these documents to the Family Registry in hard copy. It
shall not be necessary to pay any additional court fees in respect of the hard copy in
such circumstances.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bundle of documents</em></strong></p>

<p>(8) The bundle of documents required to be filed by rule 567 of the Family Justice Rules
should be paginated consecutively throughout at the top right hand corner and may be
printed on one side or both sides of each page.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) An index of contents of each bundle in the manner and form set out in Form 205
in Appendix A to these Practice Directions must also be furnished. No bundle

</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) Under rule 567(3) of the Family Justice Rules it is the responsibility of solicitors
for all parties to agree and prepare an agreed bundle as soon as possible. The
scope to which the agreement extends must be stated in the index sheet of the

</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) The documents in the bundles should —

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(d) Where originals and copies of documents are included in one bundle, it should
be stated in the index which documents are originals and which are copies.

in the bundles. In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs have been
wasted by the inclusion of unnecessary documents, the Court will have no

</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(f) A core bundle should (unless clearly unnecessary) also be provided containing
the most important documents upon which the case will turn or to which
repeated reference will have to be made. The documents in this bundle should
normally be paginated but should also be cross-referenced to copies of the
documents included in the main bundles. The bundle supplied to the Court
should be contained in a loose-leaf file which can easily have further documents
added to it if required.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><strong><em>Bundle of authorities</em></strong></p>

<p>(9) Bundles of authorities may be filed in compliance with paragraph 88(4), (5) and (6).</p>

<p>(10) Only authorities which are relevant or necessary for the trial shall be included in the
bundles. No bundle of authorities is necessary in cases where parties are not relying on
any authority at the trial. In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs have been
wasted by the inclusion of unnecessary authorities, the Court will have no hesitation in
making a special order for costs against the relevant person.</p>

<p>(11) The bundle of authorities shall be filed and served on all relevant parties at least 3
working days before trial.</p>

<p><strong><em>Opening statements</em></strong></p>

<p>(12) A proper opening statement is of great assistance to the Court as it sets out the case in a
nutshell, both as to facts and law. It is intended to identify both for the parties and the
Judge the issues that are, and are not, in dispute. It enables the Judge to appreciate what
the case is about, and what he is to look out for when reading and listening to the
evidence that will follow. Opening statements also help to clarify issues between the
parties, so that unnecessary time is not spent on trying to prove what is not disputed or
irrelevant. The need for brevity is emphasised as opening statements that contain long
and elaborate arguments, and citations from and references to numerous authorities, do
not serve this purpose.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) In the light of these objectives, opening statements will be required in all cases
from all parties, except where dispensation has been granted by the trial Judge
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>and in running down actions. Statements submitted may be taken as read by the
trial Judge.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(b) All opening statements must include the following:
(i) the nature of the case generally and the background facts insofar as they
are relevant to the matter before the Court and indicating which facts, if
any, are agreed;
(ii) the precise legal and factual issues involved are to be identified with
cross-references as appropriate to the pleadings. These issues should be
numbered and listed, and each point should be stated in no more than one
or two sentences. The object here is to identify the issues in dispute and
state each party’s position clearly, not to argue or elaborate on them;
(iii) the principal authorities in support of each legal proposition should be
listed, while the key documents and witnesses supporting each factual
proposition should be identified;
(iv) where there is a counterclaim or third party action, the opening statement
must similarly address all issues raised therein; and
(v) an explanation of the reliefs claimed (if these are unusual or
complicated).</p>

<p>(c) The plaintiff’s statement as provided for in sub-paragraph (12)(e) below, should,
unless exempted or dispensation has been granted by the trial Judge, be filed and
served on all other relevant parties not less than 3 working days before the
commencement of the trial for which they are to be used.</p>

<p>(d) The other counsel should each similarly not later than 2 working days before the
start of the trial provide to the Court (with copies at the same time to their
opponents) a statement which should concisely state the nature of their case on
each of the issues to be tried and summarise the propositions of law to be
advanced with references to the main authorities to be relied on. The character
and length of this document will depend on the circumstances and whether there
is any counterclaim or third party proceedings.</p>

<p>(e) In the case of the plaintiff, the statement must include the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(i) a summary of essential facts indicating which, if any, are agreed;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(ii) an indication of how these facts are to be proved, identifying relevant
witnesses and documents;

the pleadings;

</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(g) The following format shall be adhered to when preparing opening statements:
(i) all pages shall be paginated, with the first page (including the cover page)

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) the above documents or any of them, save for the opening statement in cases

the party who has failed to file or serve his documents within the prescribed time or at

<h2 id="91-hearing-in-chambers">91. Hearing in Chambers</h2>

<p>In all hearings in chambers before a Judge or Registrar, counsel shall submit their bundles of
documents and their own bundle of authorities. Rule 567 of the Family Justice Rules and the
requirements of Paragraphs 90(8) to (11) shall, with the necessary modifications , be complied
with in this regard, save that the bundles may be submitted at the hearing itself before the Judge

<h2 id="93-citation-of-written-judgments-and-secondary-authorities">93. Citation of written judgments and secondary authorities</h2>

<p><strong><em>Citation of written judgments</em></strong></p>

<p>Counsel who cite a judgment must state the proposition of law that the judgment establishes
and the parts of the judgment that support that proposition. Such statements should not
excessively add to the length of the submission but should be sufficient to demonstrate the
relevance of that judgment to the argument made. Where counsel wish to cite more than two
judgments as authority for a given proposition, there must be a compelling reason to do so, and
this reason must be provided by counsel in submissions.</p>

<p>Judgments from other jurisdictions can, if judiciously used, provide valuable assistance to the
Court. However, where there are in existence local judgments which are directly relevant to the
issue, such judgments should be cited in precedence to foreign judgments. Relevant local
judgments will be accorded greater weight than judgments from foreign jurisdictions. This will
ensure that the Courts are not unnecessarily burdened with judgments made in jurisdictions
with differing legal, social or economic contexts. In addition, counsel who cite a foreign
judgment must:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) draw the attention of the Court to any local judgment that may be relevant to
whether the Court should accept the proposition that the foreign judgment is said
to establish; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) ensure that such citation will be of assistance to the development of local
jurisprudence on the particular issue in question.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(1) The <strong>neutral citation system</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) A neutral citation is a court-approved system of citation which is independent of

</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Citation of secondary authorities in court
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(6) Counsel are advised to be more circumspect in their use of secondary authorities such
as textbooks, journals, periodicals and other treatises. As far as possible, counsel should
rely on primary authorities to support the proposition of law argued for; and</p>

<p>(7) If it necessary to cite secondary authorities, counsel should ensure that the material to
be cited is directly relevant to the case before the Court. Counsel are also reminded of
their duty to ensure that such material is not cited out of context. The following are
specific guidelines for the citation of different types of secondary authorities:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) Textbooks that are generally recognised as leading textbooks in the relevant area
of law may be readily cited to the Court.
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) If counsel wish to cite academic articles in journals and periodicals in support
of a particular proposition of law, they should ensure that they are citing a
statement, rather than a critique, of the law. Citation of academic articles should
be limited to those written by eminent authors of reputable standing. The
articles should also have been published in established journals and periodicals.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) Legal opinions written by other counsel not having conduct of the case before
the court should generally not be cited as authority. Such legal opinions are
considerably less authoritative than academic articles, as the views expressed in
these private opinions have not been subject to the rigorous scrutiny of editorship
and public critique.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(8) Counsel’s attention is drawn to rule 859 of the Family Justice Rules which gives the
Court the power to make an order for costs personally against errant advocates and
solicitors, who have wasted or incurred costs unreasonably or improperly. The Court
will not hesitate to invoke its powers under rule 859 of the Family Justice Rules in cases
where costs have been wasted due to counsel’s indiscriminate citation of unnecessary
and irrelevant secondary authorities.</p>

<h2 id="94-submissions-and-examination-by-leading-and-assisting-counsel">94. Submissions and examination by leading and assisting counsel</h2>

<p>(1) In the event that a party is represented by more than one counsel at a hearing, whether
in Court or in chambers, the making of submissions and the questioning of witnesses
may be carried out by one counsel for each party only.</p>

<p>(2) If counsel have divided up their work such that it is necessary or desirable that
submissions on different issues be made or certain portions of the examination, cross-
examination or re-examination be conducted by different counsel, an application should
be made to Court at the commencement of the trial or hearing for leave to do so. The
following information should be provided to the Court for the purposes of the
application:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) the issues on which each counsel will be making submissions; and/or
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) the witnesses to be examined, cross-examined or re-examined by each counsel,
or the portions of their evidence for which each counsel will conduct the
examination, cross-examination or re-examination.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(3) If leave has been granted in accordance with sub-paragraph (2), counsel should ensure
that each confines himself to the issues or portions of evidence in respect of which leave
was granted and that there is no overlap in the issues or the examination being dealt
with by different counsel for the same party. Further, counsel must not repeat, clarify
or expand on any submissions or portions thereof that have been made by another
counsel for the same party or examine, cross-examine or re-examine witnesses on
portions of their evidence dealt with by another counsel for the same party.</p>

<p>(4) If leave of the Court is not sought in accordance with sub-paragraph (2), only one
counsel will be allowed to make submissions or conduct examination for a party
throughout the hearing.</p>

<p>(5) This Paragraph shall apply to all proceedings in the Family Courts, Juvenile Courts and
Family Division of the High Court.</p>

<h2 id="95-amendment-of-documents">95. Amendment of documents</h2>

<p><strong><em>General requirements for amendment of any document</em></strong></p>

<p>(1) Except as otherwise provided by the provisions of this Paragraph, where any document
(inclusive of any pleading) that has been filed in any proceedings is required to be
amended and re-filed in Court, a fresh copy of the document with the amendments
included must be prepared, regardless of the number and length of the amendments
sought to be made.</p>

<p>(2) The procedure for amending a document is as follows:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) A fresh amended copy of the document should be produced.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) The number of times the document has been amended shall be indicated (in
brackets) after the name of the document. For this purpose, an amended
document should be entitled “[document name] (Amendment No. 1)” or
“[document name] (Amendment No. 2)”, or as appropriate. For example, a
Statement of Claim which is amended for the first time should be filed as
“Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1)”, and a Defence that is amended for
the second time should be filed as “Defence (Amendment No. 2)”.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) The changes made in the document from the latest version of the document filed
in Court should be indicated in the following way:
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(i) deletions shall be made by drawing a single line across the words to be
deleted; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(ii) insertions shall be underlined.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><strong><em>Colour scheme for amendments</em></strong></p>

<p>(3) In addition, the following colours shall be used to indicate the history of the
amendments in the specified documents:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) black for the first round of amendments;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) red for the second round of amendments;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) green for the third round of amendments;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(d) blue for the fourth round of amendments; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(e) brown for subsequent rounds of amendments.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong><em>Amendment for third time or more</em></strong></p>

<p>(4) From the <em>third</em> round of amendments onwards, the amended specified document should
comprise two versions of the document, i.e. —</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) a clean version without the amendments shown; followed in the same document
by
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) a version showing the amendments in colour.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(5) Only one amended document consisting of these two versions is required to be filed.</p>

<p><strong><em>Cases to which the requirements in sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) do not apply</em></strong></p>

<p>(6) The directions in sub-paragraph (2)(b) above shall not apply to any originating
summons or summons that has been amended from an <em>inter partes</em> application to an <em>ex
parte</em> application or <em>vice versa</em>.</p>

<p>(7) The directions in sub-paragraphs (2)(c) above shall not apply to any originating process,
summons or other electronic form that is composed online through the Electronic Filing
Service.</p>

<p><strong><em>Amendment endorsements on electronic forms</em></strong></p>

<p>(8) Rule 426(3) of the Family Justice Rules requires that an amended pleading or other
document be endorsed with a statement that it has been amended, specifying the date
on which it was amended and by whom the order (if any) authorising the amendment
was made and the date thereof, and if no such order was made, the number of the Rule
in Part 18 Division 14 of the Family Justice Rules in pursuance of which the amendment
was made.</p>

<p>(9) Where electronic forms are amended, the amendment endorsement shall take either one
of the following forms:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) “By order of court made on [date order was made]”; or
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) “Pursuant to Rule [cite specific rule number]”.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(10) The amendment endorsement shall be appended to the title of the electronic form, after
the amendment number as required under sub-paragraph (2)(b) above. Where an
electronic form is amended more than once, the endorsement need only cite the basis
for the most recent amendment. For example —</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) “Originating Summons (Amendment No. 3, by order of court made on 1 January
2013)”;
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) “Writ of Summons (Amendment No. 1, pursuant to r420)”.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(11) The date of the electronic form shall reflect the date on which the document is amended.</p>

<p><strong><em>Amendments made on original writ or originating summons (where amendments are not
numerous or lengthy)</em></strong></p>

<p>(12) This sub-paragraph applies to writs and originating summonses that have not been filed
using the Electronic Filing Service. In addition to the usual endorsement signed by the
solicitors pursuant to Paragraph 73 of these Practice Directions, there should be re-
sealing of the document as required by rule 426(1), of the Family Justice Rules. The
seal will be embossed over the endorsement.</p>

<p><strong><em>Amendment of case title to add a party</em></strong></p>

<p>(13) Where leave of Court has been obtained to add a party to the main case title of a matter,
for example, an intervener, a garnishee or any party that was previously a non-party, the
applicant or his solicitor is to file a Request through the Electronic Filing Service to add
that specific party to the main case title.</p>

or sessions, provided that such use does not in any way disrupt or trivialise the
proceedings.</p>

<p>(4) This Paragraph shall apply to all family and juvenile proceedings in the Family Justice
Courts.</p>

<p>(5) For the avoidance of doubt, this Paragraph shall also apply to all alternative dispute

<p>(1) For proceedings in Family Courts or Family Division of the High Court which have
been commenced using the Electronic Filing Service, every application for the court
records in those proceedings (including notes of evidence, certified transcripts or
grounds of decision) must be made by way of filing the appropriate Request in the
Electronic Filing Service to the Registry of the Family Justice Courts.</p>

<p>(2) On approval, copies of the court records will be made available upon payment of an

<p><strong><em>Access by parties to a case file</em></strong></p>

<p>(1) All parties to a case who are registered users of the Electronic Filing Service may,
subject to this paragraph and any directions of the Court, access the online case file
made available through the Electronic Filing Service and may inspect, download soft
copies or print hard copies of documents accessible to the parties in the online case file.</p>

<p>(2) Where a party to a case is not a registered user and is unable to access the electronic
case file through the Electronic Filing Service, the procedure governing file inspection
by non-parties to a case in sub-paragraph (5) below shall be followed.</p>

<p>(3) All parties to a case shall have the liberty to make amendments at will to administrative
details contained in the electronic case file through the Electronic Filing Service, and
for this purpose —</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) administrative details include the contact details of solicitors, the identities of
the solicitors, and the nature of the claim; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) where a party to a case is not a registered user of the Electronic Filing Service,
he may attend at the service bureau to seek assistance to amend the
administrative details contained in the electronic case file.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(4) The Registry may require parties to a case to provide supporting documents to
substantiate proposed amendments to other details of the electronic case file before the
amendment is approved (e.g. amendments to add or remove a party to the case have to
be supported by an order of court, and amendments to change the name, gender,
identification number, or marital status of a party to the case have to be substantiated
by documentary proof).</p>

<p><strong><em>File inspection by non-parties</em></strong></p>

<p>(5) In order to inspect a case file containing documents that were filed through the
Electronic Filing Service, the following procedure should be followed:
(a) A Request should be made to obtain leave to inspect the file, which request
should —</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(i) be filed using the Electronic Filing Service;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(ii) state the name of the person who is to carry out the search or inspection
(and if this person is not a solicitor, his identity card number should also
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>be included in the request, after his name, and a copy of his identity card
should be provided);
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(iii) state the interest the applicant has in the matter, and the reason for the
search or inspection; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(iv) if the search or inspection is requested for the purpose of ascertaining
information for use in a separate suit or matter, clearly state the nature of
the information sought and the relevance of such information to the
separate suit or matter.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) Once approval for inspection has been received from the Court:
(i) Registered users can inspect the case file online through the Electronic
Filing Service;
(ii) Parties who are not registered users can inspect the case file by
presenting a copy of the approval at the service bureau. After verifying
the approval that has been presented, the service bureau will assign a
personal computer to the inspecting party for the inspection to be carried
out. An inspecting party will usually be allowed only 60 minutes to carry
out the inspection. If a longer period is required, the service bureau may
impose a charge for use of the computer. The service bureau may impose
additional charges for downloading soft copies or printing hard copies
of documents from the case file being inspected.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(6) Requests in hard copy may be submitted to inspect case files containing documents
which were not filed using the Electronic Filing Service. The Family Registry will only
accept requests which are printed or typewritten on paper of good quality and signed by
the solicitors concerned. Requests which have any erasure marks on them will be
rejected. Requests which are double stamped, that is, if the requests were originally
short stamped and later stamped to add up to the correct fee, may be rejected.</p>

<p>(7) Solicitors must communicate to the Registrar in writing the names of their clerks who
have their authority to make searches and inspections. Such authority may be in respect
of a specific search or inspection or for a specified period.</p>

<p>(8) For the avoidance of doubt, a non-party who has obtained approval to inspect a case file
may take and retain a soft copy of any document that is available for inspection. All
copies of documents taken in the course of inspection should not be used for purposes
other than those stated in the Request to inspect. Solicitors shall be responsible for
informing their clients of this.</p>

<p><strong><em>Obtaining certified true copies of documents</em></strong></p>

<p>(9) Applications to obtain certified true paper copies of documents should be made by way
of filing a Request through the Electronic Filing Service, unless the documents
concerned have not been filed through the Electronic Filing Service.</p>

<p>(10) The intended use of the certified true copies should be clearly stated in the Request. The
relevance and necessity of the certified true copies in relation to their intended use
should also be clearly described.</p>

<p>(11) Once approval is received from the Court, the applicant should present a printed copy
of the approved Request at the Records Section. After verifying that the Request
presented has been approved, the staff of the Records Section will inform the applicant
of any additional fees payable. Where additional fees are payable, these fees should then
be stamped on the Request at the Family Justice Courts’ Cashier’s Office. Upon
presentation of this stamped Request, the documents will be furnished to the applicant.</p>

<p>(12) The fees prescribed by Part 19 of the Family Justice Rules will be payable for the above
services without prejudice to additional printing charges which may be chargeable by
the Court or the service bureau for reproducing the copies in paper form.</p>

<p><strong><em>Conducting searches of information maintained by the Registry</em></strong></p>

<p>(13) Rule 889 of the Family Justice Rules provides that the Registry shall maintain
information prescribed or required to be kept by the Family Justice Rules and practice
directions issued by the Registrar. In addition to any provisions in the Family Justice
Rules, the Registrar hereby directs that the following information shall be maintained
by the Registry:
(a) details of all originating processes in Family Justice Courts, including:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(i) details of interlocutory applications;

</div>
<p>(14) Searches of this information under rule 891 of the Family Justice Rules may be
conducted through the Electronic Filing Service at a service bureau or at the Records
Section. The fees prescribed by Part 19 of the Family Justice Rules will be payable for
the searches.</p>

<p>(15) An application may be made by any person for a licence to use any information
contained in any electronic cause book or register subject to such terms and conditions
as the Registrar may determine. Successful applicants will be required to enter into
separate technical services agreements with the Electronic Filing Service provider.
Applications under this paragraph must be made in writing, identifying the data fields
sought and providing details of how the information will be used.</p>

<p><strong><em>Issuance of subpoenas</em></strong></p>

<p>(1) An application for a subpoena shall be made by way of filing a subpoena in Form 123
in Appendix A to these Practice Directions. The subpoena is deemed to be issued when

<h2 id="111-swearing-or-affirming-of-affidavits-statutory-declarations-and-oaths">111. Swearing or affirming of affidavits, statutory declarations and oaths</h2>

<p>(1) Rule 8 of the Commissioners for Oaths Rules (Cap. 322, Rule 3) was amended effective
1 September 1998 to permit an advocate and solicitor who is appointed a commissioner
for oaths to take affidavits or statutory declarations, or administer oaths to a deponent
in a language or dialect, other than English, spoken or understood by the deponent and
in which the advocate and solicitor is proficient in. Given these amendments, advocates
and solicitors are requested to encourage their clients to use the services of other
advocates and solicitors who are appointed commissioners for oaths and who are
proficient in the language or dialect in which the affidavits or statutory declarations are
to be sworn or affirmed, or in which the oaths are to be taken. The Family Justice Courts’
commissioners for oaths will continue to take affidavits or statutory declarations and
administer oaths for legally aided cases and for parties who are acting in person who
need to file documents in the Family Justice Courts.</p>

<p>(2) If arrangements for the use of the services of advocates and solicitors who are appointed
as commissioners for oaths are not possible, deponents who are blind or illiterate in
English may continue to be brought by solicitors to the Family Justice Courts’
commissioners for oaths to swear or affirm affidavits and statutory declarations. As the
Family Justice Courts’ commissioners for oaths are under a duty to ensure that the
deponent understands the document being deposed to, they are obliged to interpret the
document to intended deponents; this is also the case in relation to blind
deponents. This necessary exercise may take a considerable time and may cause long
delays for other persons who wish to take affidavits or statutory declarations before the
Family Justice Courts’ commissioners for oaths.</p>

<p>(3) Accordingly, solicitors who wish to bring illiterate or blind deponents before the Family
Justice Courts’ commissioners for oaths should first estimate the time that will be taken
to interpret the document or documents to be deposed to. If it is estimated that the total
time required for interpretation of the documents will be more than 20 minutes, the
solicitor must write to the Registrar and arrange for a special appointment for the
documents to be sworn or affirmed; the solicitor should not bring the deponent before
the duty commissioner for oaths without such an appointment.</p>

<p>(4) If an illiterate or a blind deponent is brought before the duty Family Justice Courts
commissioner for oaths and the interpretation of the document or documents takes more
than 20 minutes, the commissioner for oaths will refer the solicitor and the deponent to
the Registrar for a special appointment to be made for the documents to be deposed to.</p>

<p>(5) Save in exceptional circumstances, the Family Justice Courts will not entertain requests
from advocates and solicitors for its commissioners for oaths to swear or affirm
affidavits or statutory declarations or administer oaths to a deponent outside the Family
Justice Courts’ premises. Advocates and solicitors appointed as commissioners for</p>

<p>oaths and who are proficient in the language or dialect in which the affidavits or
statutory declarations are to be sworn or affirmed, or in which oaths are to be taken, are
instead encouraged to perform this function</p>

<p>(1) Rule 805(4) of the Family Justice Rules states that it is the appellant’s duty to apply to
the Judge or other person presiding at the proceedings in which the decision appealed
against was given, for the signed copy of any note made by him of the proceedings and
to furnish that copy for the use of the Court. For the avoidance of doubt, the onus is on
the appellant to file a record of proceedings, comprising the signed copy of the notes of
proceedings, and any further grounds of decision, in the Family Division of the High
Court.</p>

<p>(2) The appellant and the respondent are to tender one hard copy of the notes of

Skeletal arguments are not formal documents and do not bind parties. They are a
valuable tool to the Judges and are meant to expedite the hearing of the appeal. These
notes should comply with the following requirements:</p>

<h2 id="144-documents-which-must-be-filed-served-delivered-etc-using-the-electronic-filing-service">144. Documents which must be filed, served, delivered etc., using the Electronic Filing Service</h2>

<p>(1) Pursuant to rules 913 and 920 of the Family Justice Rules, the Registrar hereby specifies
that all documents to be filed with, served on, delivered or otherwise conveyed to the
Registrar in all proceedings, subject to the exceptions which appear later in this
Paragraph, must be so filed, served, delivered or otherwise conveyed using the
Electronic Filing Service.</p>

<p>(2) It shall not be necessary to use the Electronic Filing Service in respect of the following
proceedings:</p>

<p>(a) any petition for divorce</p>

<p>(3) Parties are to note that the documents which are to be filed pursuant to rule 567(1) of
the Family Justice Rules may, instead of being filed through the Electronic Filing
Service, be filed in accordance with the procedure outlined in Paragraph 90(3)-(7).</p>

<p>(4) In respect of appeals under Part 18 Division 59 of the Family Justice Rules, it shall not
be necessary to file, deliver or convey any document at the Family Division of the High
Court using the Electronic Filing Service if its filing, service, delivery or conveyance is
not required under Part 18 Division 59 of the Family Justice Rules.</p>

<p>(5) Where documents are served using the Electronic Filing Service, a Certificate of Service
will be automatically generated and stored in the electronic case file.</p>

<p>(6) Bundles of authorities can be filed, served, delivered or otherwise conveyed using the
Electronic Filing Service. A party may also choose not to file bundles of authorities
and may instead use hardcopies for hearings in accordance with the Directions
contained in this Part.</p>

<h2 id="145-form-of-documents">145. Form of documents</h2>

<p>(1) It is not necessary for documents that are electronically filed in Court to have a cover
page or backing sheet.</p>

<p>(2) Parties are reminded that they must, at all times, ensure that the information stored in
the front end system is up-to-date and free from errors as the same information will be
reproduced in electronic forms that are generated by the Electronic Filing Service.</p>

<p>(3) Documents generated by the Electronic Filing Service containing out-of-date or wrong
information will be rejected by the Registry and the fee payable shall be that stipulated
in Part 19 of the Family Justice Rules.</p>

<p>(4) In the event that the Electronic Filing Service fails to automatically generate an
information page, parties may undertake the procedure outlined in Paragraph 151(2) of
these Practice Directions.</p>

<p>(5) If a document generated by the Electronic Filing Service is in respect of an Originating
Summons or Petition for Probate or Letters of Administration where the parties are
described as “Petitioner” and “Respondent”, parties should first write to the Family
Registry by way of a Request through the Electronic Filing Service to request the
convening of a Case Conference in respect of the matter. At the PTC, appropriate
directions will be given to change the references to “Petitioner” and “Respondent” in
the case title to “Plaintiff” and “Defendant” or such other party description as
appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="146-pagination-of-documents">146. Pagination of documents</h2>

<p>Every single page of a document <em>must</em> be paginated so that the pagination on the actual
document corresponds with the pagination of the document in the electronic case file. This is
to facilitate hearings involving documents.</p>

<h2 id="147-filing-documents-through-service-bureau">147. Filing documents through service bureau</h2>

<p>(1) Solicitors and law firms are encouraged to file documents through the Electronic Filing
Service. However, in the event that certain documents cannot be filed through the
Electronic Filing Service, solicitors and law firms may file documents through the
service bureau. Litigants in person may also file documents through the service bureau.</p>

<p>(2) The operating hours of the service bureau may be found on the Electronic Filing Service
website at <a href="http://www.elitigation.sg.">http://www.elitigation.sg.</a></p>

<p>(3) [Deleted]</p>

<p>(4) Any document which is accepted for filing outside the time periods specified on the
Electronic Filing Service website at <a href="http://www.elitigation.sg,">http://www.elitigation.sg,</a> will be treated by the service
bureau as having been accepted on the following working day.</p>

<p>(5) Documents to be filed through the service bureau must comply with these Practice
Directions and all applicable administrative instructions and procedures prescribed by
the service bureau with the approval of the superintendent.</p>

<p>(6) Documents filed through the service bureau shall be subject to a Manual Handling Fee
as set out in the Electronic Filing Service website at <a href="http://www.elitigation.sg,">http://www.elitigation.sg,</a> and additional
services made available by the service bureau may be subject to other administrative
charges imposed by the service bureau with the approval of the superintendent.</p>

<h2 id="148-filing-of-documents-to-the-family-justice-courts-through-a-supreme-court-service-bureau">148. Filing of documents to the Family Justice Courts through a Supreme Court service bureau</h2>

<p>Pursuant to rule 929(4) of the Family Justice Rules, the Registrar hereby prescribes that any
service bureau established or authorised to be established by the Registrar of the Supreme Court
may assist in the filing, service, delivery or conveyance of documents pertaining to:-</p>

<p>(a) proceedings in the Family Division of the High Court, and</p>

<p>(b) Family Courts using the Electronic Filing Service if the service bureau, or, if there are
more than one, all the service bureaux, established or authorised to be established by
the Registrar are unable to provide such services owing to failure of hardware or
software, or both.</p>

<h2 id="149-limits-on-the-size-and-number-of-documents-submitted-using-the-electronic-filing-service">149. Limits on the size and number of documents submitted using the Electronic Filing Service</h2>

<p>(1) The following limits apply to the filing of documents using the Electronic Filing
Service:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) the total number of documents in a single submission must not exceed 99; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) the size of a single submission must not exceed 500 mega-bytes.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(2) The limits described above apply to filing both online through the Electronic Filing
Service and the service bureau.</p>

<p>(3) The resolution for scanning, unless otherwise directed by the Court, must be no more
than 300 DPI.</p>

<p>(4) In the event that any solicitor wishes to file documents which exceed the limits specified
in sub-paragraph (1), he should inform the Registrar at least 14 days before the intended
filing date. The solicitor will then be asked to attend before the Registrar for directions
to be given on how the documents should be filed.</p>

<p>(5) If any document should exceed 300 pages, then that document shall be sub-divided, at
a convenient page, into parts, for example, Affidavit of Tan Ah Kow Part A, Affidavit
of Tan Ah Kow Part B and so on.</p>

<h2 id="150-documents-which-cannot-be-converted-into-an-electronic-format">150. Documents which cannot be converted into an electronic format</h2>

<p>(1) If a document cannot be converted in whole or in part into an electronic format for any
reason, the hardcopy of the document must be filed at the Family Registry of the Family
Justice Courts.</p>

<p>(2) If the Court receives a document which the filing party says cannot be converted in
whole or part into an electronic format, and it can discern no good reason why the
document cannot be wholly converted into an electronic format, the document may be
rejected.</p>

<h2 id="151-rejection-of-documents-back-dating-and-refund-of-penalty">151. Rejection of documents, back-dating and refund of penalty</h2>

<p>(1) Care must be taken to enter correct, complete and accurate information into the
electronic form. If the information entered into the electronic form and the actual
document differ, the document is likely to be rejected by the Court. If a document is
rejected by the Court for any reason, a penalty may nonetheless be payable in respect
of the document as specified in Part 19 of the Family Justice Rules. In this regard,
solicitors’ attention is also drawn to rule 928 of the Family Justice Rules.</p>

<p>(2) In the event however that any document is rejected through no fault of the filing party,
a solicitor may —</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) re-file the document with a request that the date and time of filing or issuance,
as the case may be, be back-dated to an earlier date and time, pursuant to rule
922 of the Family Justice Rules; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) request a refund of the penalty by filing the requisite electronic form through the
Electronic Filing Service.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(3) Where leave of Court has been obtained to expunge parts of a document or affidavit
from the Court record, an applicant or his solicitor must re-file the document or affidavit
with the expunged parts redacted and with a request that the date and time of filing or
issuance, as the case may be, be back-dated to an earlier date and time, pursuant to rule
922 of the Family Justice Rules.</p>

<p>(4) For the avoidance of doubt, a filing fee will be payable in respect of the re-filed
document or affidavit as specified in Part 19 of the Family Justice Rules and the filing
fee paid on the earlier filing of that document or affidavit will not be refunded.</p>

<h2 id="152-hard-copies-of-documents-filed-electronically">152. Hard copies of documents filed electronically</h2>

<p>(1) The Registrar may, at his discretion, request for hard copies of any documents filed
electronically.</p>

<p>(2) Upon such request, the filing party or his solicitor shall furnish hard copies of the
relevant documents at the venue specified by the Registrar —</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) within the specified time frame; or
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) within 24 hours of the request, if no time frame is specified.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(3) The Registrar may also direct that any or all documents shall be filed in hardcopy instead
of using the Electronic Filing Service for such period or periods as he in his discretion
thinks fit.</p>

<h2 id="153-responsibility-for-accuracy-and-completeness-of-information-submitted-using-the-electronic-filing-service">153. Responsibility for accuracy and completeness of information submitted using the Electronic Filing Service</h2>

<p>(1) The solicitor having the conduct of any cause or matter may delegate the task of filing
originating processes and documents in Court to an assistant or a suitably experienced
law clerk or secretary, provided always that the solicitor shall personally satisfy himself
as to the accuracy and completeness of the information submitted to the Court, and shall
personally bear responsibility for any errors or deficiencies.
(2) In particular, solicitors should ensure the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) that the title of the action generated using the Electronic Filing Service is
accurate and correct;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) where an action is commenced by way of a writ of summons, that at least one
nature of claim is selected that adequately represents the subject matter of the
action; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) where an action is commenced by way of an originating summons, that either
the relevant legislation under which the action is brought is provided or at least
one nature of claim is selected that adequately represents the subject matter of
the action.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><strong><em>Consolidated, transferred or converted cases in civil proceedings</em></strong></p>

<p>(3) Where leave of Court has been obtained to consolidate cases or transfer a case from the
Supreme Court to the Family Justice Courts or an order is made in a matter commenced
by originating summons to continue as if commenced by writ, the applicant or his
solicitor must inform the Registry of the order for consolidation or transfer or
conversion by way of an appropriate Request through the Electronic Filing Service.</p>

<h2 id="154-amendment-of-documents-originally-filed-in-court-by-entering-relevant-information-in-an-electronic-template">154. Amendment of documents originally filed in Court by entering relevant information in an electronic template</h2>

<p>(1) This Paragraph applies to documents that have originally been filed in Court via the
Electronic Filing Service.</p>

<p>(2) Where such a document is to be amended, whether pursuant to rule 60 of the Family
Justice Rules or, with leave of court, the amended document is to be prepared and filed
by entering the relevant amendments in the appropriate electronic template. The
amended document need not be filed in PDF format. In this respect, Paragraph 95(2)(c),
(4) and (5) of these Practice Directions shall not apply.</p>

<h2 id="155-filing-directions-to-the-accountant-general-for-payment-into-and-out-of-court">155. Filing directions to the Accountant-General for payment into and out of Court</h2>

<p>(1) Where monies are sought to be paid into Court pursuant to a judgment or order of the
Court, a copy of the judgment or order must be referenced in the draft direction to the
Accountant-General for payment in submitted to the Registry for approval.</p>

<p>(2) Where monies are sought to be paid out of Court pursuant to a judgment or order of the
Court, pursuant to the acceptance of a payment into Court made under Part 18 Division
16 of the Family Justice Rules, a copy of the judgment or order, or of the notice in Form
92 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions, or of the written consent, must be
attached to the draft direction to the Accountant-General for payment out submitted to
the Registry for approval.</p>

<p>(3) Every draft direction for payment into or payment out of Court shall contain amounts
in a single currency.</p>

<p>(4) Where monies in different currencies are to be paid into or out of Court, separate draft
directions must be prepared for each currency in which payment is to be made.</p>

<h2 id="156-electronic-payment-of-court-fees">156. Electronic payment of Court fees</h2>

<p>(1) Court fees not paid using the Electronic Filing Service may be paid by electronic means.</p>

<p>(2) Payment through electronic means includes payment effected by Interbank GIRO (IBG)
and NETS. For law firms, payment by IBG would be the most appropriate mode of
electronic payment. A law firm using IBG will authorise the Family Justice Court to
deduct the fees from its bank account upon lodgement of the prescribed lodgement form.
The law firm will receive detailed reports on its IBG payments to facilitate accounting
and help with bank reconciliation.</p>

<h2 id="157-stamping-of-documents">157. Stamping of documents</h2>

<p>(1) Only documents filed in the Family Justice Courts will be stamped at the Family Justice
Courts’ stamp office. The amount of stamp fees payable must be indicated on the top
right hand corner of the document. In addition, solicitor’s clerks or solicitors must
complete and submit the requisition form set out in Form 258 of Appendix A, together

Singapore currency). Cashier’s Orders and Bank Drafts should be crossed and made
payable to:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>“Registrar, Supreme Court/AG”

</div>
<p>(3) The stamp office shall be opened during the following hours:</p>

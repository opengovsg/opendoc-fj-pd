concerned in order that that party may engage a new counsel to pursue the case through
litigation.</p>

<h2 id="18-uncontested-matrimonial-proceedings-in-chambers">18. Uncontested Matrimonial Proceedings in Chambers</h2>

shall, at the same time, file the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) where the plaintiff is proceeding on the statement of claim, the Affidavit of

sent to the other party at the same time by the filing party.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(3) Where the documents are in order, the court may proceed to grant the relevant orders
in chambers without requiring the attendance of the parties.</p>

<p>(4) Notwithstanding the above, the Court has the discretion to fix the matter for open court
hearing and require the attendance of parties.</p>

<p>(5) This procedure shall be complied with by counsel acting for the party filing the Request
for Setting Down Action for Trial in all applicable cases unless an application for
exemption is submitted citing special grounds (for example where parties wish to make
any further application related to the grant of an interim judgment, including
applications for abridgment of time).</p>

<p>(6) If parties are applying for an exemption under sub-paragraph (5) above, the party filing
the Request for Setting Down Action for Trial on an uncontested basis shall, at the same
time, file Form 204 instead of Form 203in Appendix A to these Practice Directions.</p>

<h2 id="19-uncontested-matrimonial-proceedings-in-open-court-hearings">19. Uncontested Matrimonial Proceedings in open court hearings</h2>

<p>(2) For the open court hearings of uncontested matrimonial proceedings under section 105
and 106, Part X of the Women’s Charter or pursuant to Paragraphs 18(4) and 18(5)
above, there is no need for the plaintiff to be made to confirm every paragraph of the
statement of claim and statement of particulars. Counsel will only need to put to the
plaintiff in the witness box the questions which will prove the following matters:</p>

the statement of claim and statement of particulars to their respective clients.</p>

<p>(4) If parties have reached an ancillary matters agreement, and intend to have it recorded
at the open court hearing, counsel shall file the draft consent order incorporating the
terms of the said agreement at least 7 working days prior to the open court hearing. The</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>document name selected for the draft consent order in the Electronic Filing Service shall
be “Draft Consent Order”.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(5) Notwithstanding the adoption of this simplified procedure, counsel will still be expected
to bring to the attention of the Court any specific matters in connection with or arising
from the proceedings of which the Court should be aware. In particular, if section 123
of the Women’s Charter is applicable, the Directions set out in Paragraph 10 of these
Practice Directions shall be complied with.</p>

<h2 id="20-documents-for-use-in-trials-of-contested-matrimonial-proceedings-under-part-x-of-the-womens-charter-cap-353">20. Documents for use in trials of contested matrimonial proceedings under Part X of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353)</h2>

<p>(1) This Paragraph shall apply to trials of contested matrimonial proceedings. For
matrimonial proceedings filed before 1 April 2006, any reference in this Paragraph to
the plaintiff and defendant shall be read as a reference to the petitioner and respondent
respectively.</p>

<p>(2) To improve the conduct of contested matrimonial proceedings and to reduce the time
taken in the presentation of cases in Court, the following documents shall be prepared
by the respective solicitors of the parties:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) a bundle of documents (an agreed bundle where possible);
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) a bundle of authorities; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) an opening statement.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><strong><em>Bundle of documents</em></strong></p>

<p>(3) Documents to be used at trial should be consolidated into bundles paginated
consecutively throughout at the top right hand corner. An index of contents of each
bundle in the manner and form set out in Form 205 of Appendix A must also be
furnished. No bundle of documents is necessary in cases where parties are not relying
on any document at the trial.</p>

<p>(4) It is the responsibility of solicitors for all parties to agree and prepare an agreed bundle
as soon as possible. The scope to which the agreement extends must be stated in the
index sheet of the agreed bundle.</p>

<p>(5) In cases where certain documents cannot be agreed upon, these should be separately
bundled as the plaintiff’s bundle, the defendant’s bundle or such other party’s bundle
as the case may be.</p>

<p>(6) The documents in the bundles should —</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) be firmly secured together with plastic ring binding or plastic spine thermal
binding. The rings or spines should be red for plaintiffs and blue for defendants
with a transparent plastic cover in front and at the back;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) have flags to mark out documents to which repeated references will be made in
the course of the hearing. Such flags shall bear the appropriate indicium by
which the document is indicated in the index of contents. Flags shall be spaced
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>out evenly along the right side of the bundle so that as far as possible they do
not overlap one another; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) be legible. Clear legible photocopies of original documents may be exhibited
instead of the originals provided the originals are made available for inspection
by the other parties before the hearing and by the Judge at the hearing.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(7) Where originals and copies of documents are included in one bundle, it should be stated
in the index which documents are originals and which are copies.</p>

<p>(8) Only documents which are relevant or necessary for the trial shall be included in the
bundles. In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs have been wasted by the
inclusion of unnecessary documents, the Court will have no hesitation in making a
special order for costs against the relevant person.</p>

<p>(9) A core bundle should (unless clearly unnecessary) also be provided containing the most
important documents upon which the case will turn or to which repeated reference will
have to be made. The documents in this bundle should normally be paginated but
should also be cross-referenced to copies of the documents included in the main
bundles. The bundle supplied to the Court should be contained in a loose-leaf file
which can easily have further documents added to it if required.</p>

<p>(10) The bundles of documents including the agreed bundle and core bundle, if applicable,
shall be filed and served on all relevant parties at least 3 days before trial.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bundle of authorities</em></strong></p>

<p>(11) The requirements set out in Paragraph 90(9) to (11) shall, with the necessary
modifications, be complied with in respect of proceedings falling within this Paragraph.</p>

<p><strong><em>Opening statements</em></strong></p>

<p>(12) The requirements set out in Paragraph 90(12) shall, with the necessary modifications,
be complied with.</p>

<p><strong><em>Timeline for tendering documents</em></strong></p>

<p>(13) Paragraphs 90(13) and 90(14) shall apply, with the necessary modifications, to
proceedings to which this Paragraph applies.</p>

<h2 id="21-affidavit-of-assets-and-means">21. Affidavit of Assets and Means</h2>

<p>(1) The Affidavit of Assets and Means (“AOM”) to be filed pursuant to rule 89 of the
Family Justice Rules shall be in Form 206 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions.</p>

<h2 id="11-mediation-andor-counselling-directed-by-court">11. Mediation and/or Counselling Directed by Court</h2>

<p>(1) In any proceedings before the Court, it may direct that parties attend mediation and/or
counselling (pursuant to section 50 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) or section 26(9)
of the Family Justice Act 2014 (Act 27 of 2014)) to encourage parties to resolve the
matter amicably and assist parties in reaching an agreement or to narrow the issues in
contention. Sub-paragraphs (2) to (10) below apply to private mediations ordered by
the Court, and sub-paragraphs (11) to (19) below apply to mediations and/or
counselling conducted by the Court.</p>

<p>(1A) It is the professional duty of advocates and solicitors to advise their clients about
mediation. Mediation should be considered at the earliest possible stage in order to
facilitate an amicable resolution of the dispute.</p>

<p>Court Ordered Private Mediation
(2) With effect from 1 October 2016, the Court will no longer conduct mediation in relation
to proceedings (including divorce proceedings, applications pursuant to section 121B
of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) and proceedings for a grant of probate or letters of
administration in respect of the estate and effects of a deceased person) which meet the
following criteria:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) there is a contested issue relating to assets where the gross value of all known
assets is S$3 million or above; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) there are no contested child issues (i.e. disputes relating to the custody, care and
control of and/or access to any child).
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(3) The Registrar or the Judge may order that parties in proceedings which meet the criteria
attend private mediation conducted by the Singapore Mediation Centre (“SMC”),
unless parties have agreed upon a mediator (“Agreed Private Mediator”). The Registrar
or the Judge may also make any orders necessary, including any orders pertaining to
the payment of the mediation and its related fees.</p>

<p>(4) For mediations conducted by the SMC, the parties and/or counsel shall provide the
Registrar or the Judge with the necessary information for the SMC to contact them to
arrange for the mediation. The Registrar or the Judge will give directions and timelines
for parties to agree on a mediation date and to exchange case information, documents
and mediation briefs. The Registrar or the Judge will fix a return date for parties and/or
counsel to update the Court on the outcome of the private mediation.</p>

<p>(5) For mediations conducted by the Agreed Private Mediators, the parties or their counsel
shall inform the Registrar or the Judge of the identity of their Agreed Private Mediator,
the management of the mediation and the agreed date for mediation. The Registrar or
Judge may make any order necessary for the timely and efficacious disposal of the case,</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>including fixing return dates for the parties or their counsel to update the court, and/or
re-directing the case to the SMC.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(6) Parties and their counsel must personally attend all mediation sessions, unless otherwise
stated by the private mediator.</p>

<p>(7) For nullity, divorce and judicial separation proceedings in which interim judgment or
judgment of judicial separation has been granted, if the dispute is resolved at the SMC
mediation or other private mediation, the parties and/or counsel may file the draft
consent order for the Court’s approval in accordance with the requirements in Paragraph
116 of these Practice Directions. Alternatively, the parties may request to attend before
the Court for the privately mediated agreement to be recorded as a consent order by the
Registrar or the Judge upon confirmation of the terms by the parties and/or counsel.</p>

<p>(8) Where interim judgment or judgment of judicial separation has not been granted, if the
dispute is resolved at the SMC mediation or other private mediation, the parties and/or
counsel shall inform the Court accordingly on the return date given by the Registrar or
the Judge pursuant to sub-paragraphs (4) or (5) above, as the case may be, and directions
will be given for the setting down of the divorce on an uncontested basis on an expedited
basis.</p>

<p>(9) For all other proceedings not covered by sub-paragraphs (7) and (8) above, parties
and/or counsel may either file the draft consent order in accordance with Paragraph 116
of these Practice Directions, or have it recorded as a consent order by the Registrar or
the Judge upon the confirmation of the terms by the parties and/or counsel.</p>

<p>(10) If the dispute is not resolved at the private mediation, the Registrar or the Judge will
give the necessary directions at the return date to enable the case to proceed accordingly.</p>

<p>Mediation conducted by the Court
(11) For child-related proceedings, a Family Dispute Resolution Conference (“FDR
Conference”) will be called to crystallise the issues of contention. All parties together
with their counsel (if any) will have to attend the FDR Conference. At the FDR
Conference, directions may be given in relation to the filing and exchanging of relevant
documents and/or proposals. Parties will also be directed to attend mediation and/or
counselling, whichever is appropriate.</p>

<p>(12) For non-child related proceedings, the Registrar or the Judge may direct parties to attend
mediation and/or counselling, whichever is appropriate.</p>

<p>(13) Counsel is not expected to attend any counselling sessions directed by the Court.
However, parties and counsel must personally attend all mediation sessions.</p>

<p>(14) For all mediation sessions, (whether child-related or otherwise) the parties and their
counsel are to prepare a Summary for Mediation in the prescribed format in Form 191
in Appendix A to these Practice Directions prior to the mediation for submission and</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>discussion during the mediation, together with all relevant documents as may be
directed by the Court.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(15) Any consensus reached during counselling sessions will be recorded as a draft
agreement. A copy of the draft will be given to the parties who are advised to consult
their counsel (if any).</p>

<p>(16) For nullity, divorce, judicial separation proceedings, where interim judgment or
judgment of judicial separation has been granted, any agreement will be recorded as a
consent order by the Judge-Mediator at a mediation session or any other Judge sitting
as a Judge in Chambers upon confirmation of the terms by the parties and/or counsel.
Where interim judgment or judgment of judicial separation has not been granted, the
agreement will be formally recorded by the Judge and directions will be given for the
setting down of the divorce on an uncontested basis on an expedited basis.</p>

<p>(17) For all other proceedings not covered by sub-paragraph (16) above, any agreement
reached will be recorded as a consent order by the Judge-Mediator at a mediation
session Mediator or any other Judge sitting as a Judge in Chambers upon the
confirmation of the terms by the parties and/or counsel.</p>

<p>(18) Mediation will be conducted on a without prejudice basis. All communications made
in the course of mediation will be treated in strict confidence and will not be admissible
in any court unless otherwise stipulated by law. If the dispute is not resolved at the
mediation session, the District Judge or Registrar will give the necessary directions to
enable the case to proceed to trial, and the case will be heard by a Judge other than the
District Judge or Registrar conducting the mediation.</p>

<p>(19) Where there is a disagreement between the parties on the terms of the agreement which
were recorded at mediation, either party may write in for a clarification before the
Judge-Mediator.</p>

<h2 id="12-mandatory-counselling--mediation">12. Mandatory Counselling &amp; Mediation</h2>

<p>(1) Section 50(3A) of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) provides for mandatory counselling
/ mediation sessions at the Child-Focused Resolution Centre (“CFRC”). The first phase,
beginning in September 2011, was for divorcing parents with any child or children
below 8 years of age. The second phase, involving divorcing parents with any child or
children below 14 years of age, was implemented for cases filed from 1st July 2013.
The final phase was implemented for cases filed from 1 October 2014 and extended to
all divorcing parents with any child or children below 21 years of age.</p>

<p>(2) Notice(s) of attendance for mandatory counselling/mediation sessions with location
details will be sent to the plaintiff and defendant in the divorce proceedings. Attendance
by the parties is compulsory. Attendance by the parties’ respective counsel, if any, is
required only when specifically stated in the notification.</p>

<p>(3) Counsel and parties are required to attend a Family Dispute Resolution Conference
(“FDR Conference”) for a preliminary discussion of the issues relating to the child or
children of the marriage. The purpose is to crystallise the issues on matters relating to
the child or children and to agree on mutually convenient dates for the parties to attend
counselling / mediation. Any unresolved issue relating to the divorce (including any
ancillary issues such as the question of maintenance or the division of matrimonial
assets) may also be discussed.</p>

<p>(4) Counsel and parties are expected to come prepared to discuss all issues relating to or
impacting the child or children.</p>

<p>(5) After the FDR Conference, the parties alone will attend an Intake and Assessment
Session with their assigned Family Counsellor.</p>

<p>(6) Subsequent counselling sessions involving only the parties, may be fixed by the
assigned Family Counsellor and the parties.</p>

<p>(7) A Mediation date will be given to the parties and counsel at the FDR Conference if
appropriate for the case. It is important that parties attend on the dates given and use
the opportunity to discuss and resolve the issues with the help of a Judge-Mediator
and/or Family Counsellor. Counsel and parties are to prepare a Summary for Mediation
in Form 191 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions prior to the mediation for
submission and discussion during the mediation together with all relevant documents
as may be directed by the Court.</p>

<p>(8) Any consensus reached during counselling sessions will be recorded as a draft
agreement. A copy of the draft will be given to the parties who are advised to consult
their counsel (if any). Where interim judgment has been granted, the agreement will be
recorded as a consent order by the Judge-Mediator at a subsequent mediation session
upon confirmation of the terms.</p>

<p>(9) Where interim judgment or judgment for judicial separation has been granted, any
agreement reached by the parties at any time may be recorded as a consent order by the
Judge–Mediator at a mediation session or any other Judge sitting as a Judge in
Chambers upon confirmation of the terms by the parties and/or counsel. Where interim
judgment or judgment of judicial separation has not been granted, the agreement will
be formally recorded by the Judge and directions will be given for the setting down of
the divorce on an uncontested basis on an expedited basis.</p>

<p>(10) Under section 50(3B) of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353), the court may dispense with
the attendance of the parties at mediation/counselling if it deems that it is not in the
interest of the parties concerned to do so (e.g. where family violence has been
committed or where Child Protection Services is involved in the case).</p>

<p>(11) Counsel should advise his/her client of the consequences of non-attendance under
section 50(3D) and (3E) of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353).</p>

<p>(12) Mediation will be conducted on a without prejudice basis. All communications made
in the course of mediation will be treated in strict confidence and will not be admissible
in any court unless otherwise stipulated by law. If the dispute is not resolved at the
mediation session, the District Judge or Registrar will give the necessary directions to
enable the case to proceed to trial, and the case will be heard by a Judge other than the
District Judge or Registrar conducting the mediation.</p>

<p>(13) Where there is a disagreement between the parties on the terms of the agreement which
were recorded at mediation, either party may write in to court for a clarification before
the Judge-Mediator.</p>

<h2 id="13-counselling">13. Counselling</h2>

<p>(1) The Court may direct that parties attend counselling pursuant to section 26(9) of the
Family Justice Act.</p>

<p>(2) Counselling is conducted to help parties manage difficult emotions related to a divorce
or any other familial relationship, and facilitating a parenting agreement that preserves
significant relationships and supports children’s psychological adjustment to the
separation. Counselling may also be directed after orders are made to assist with the
emotional aspects of dealing with the outcome of the orders particularly in cases
involving the relocation of a child.</p>

<p>(3) Counsel may attend a counselling session if the assigned counsellor considers it
appropriate.</p>

<p>(4) The counsellor may request that the child be included in the counselling sessions, either
alone or together with the parents depending on the case, if the counsellor is of the view
that it would be in the interest of the child to be involved.</p>

<p>(5) Any request for a change or vacation of the counselling appointment shall be made at
least 3 working days before the appointed date.</p>

<p>(6) Counselling sessions will be conducted on a without prejudice basis. Any consensus
reached during counselling sessions will be recorded as a draft agreement. A copy of
the draft agreement, recorded by the counsellor and signed by the parties, will be given
to the parties to seek further advice from their respective counsel (if any). The draft
agreement and all communications made in the course of counselling will be treated in
strict confidence and shall not be admissible in any court.</p>

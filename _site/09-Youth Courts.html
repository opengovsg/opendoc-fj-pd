<h2 id="32-magistrates-complaints-private-summonses">32. Magistrate’s complaints (Private summonses)</h2>

<p>(1) Framing of criminal charges
Solicitors representing the complainants (save in maintenance cases) are to frame and
submit the charges when the complaints are filed. This will facilitate the immediate
issuance of the summons if it is so ordered by the Duty Magistrate.</p>

<p>(2) Infringement of copyright/trademarks
Magistrate’s complaints involving infringement of copyright/trademarks must be sworn
by authorised representatives. A letter of authorization to that effect must be attached
to the complaint.</p>

Criminal Procedure Code 2010 must be served at least 7 days before the return
date of the summons if such service is undertaken by the firm’s clerk. This is
because the authorization to serve will lapse 7 days before the return date.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) If the summons is already served on the respondent 7 days before the mention
date, the attached summons must be returned to the Youth Court Registry
immediately after service. Failure to do so will result in the summons not being
listed for mention.

</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) If the summons cannot be served on the respondent 1 week before the mention
date, the authorization to serve will lapse. In order to obtain further
authorization for the firm's clerk to serve the summons on the respondent or to
obtain an extension of the return date, the solicitor must appear before the Duty
Magistrate not later than 5 days before the return date. Failure to comply with
this may result in the complaint being struck off the list.

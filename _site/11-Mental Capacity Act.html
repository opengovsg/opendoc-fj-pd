      <h1 id="part-xi--mental-capacity-act">Part XI – Mental Capacity Act</h1>

<h2 id="45-proceedings-under-the-mental-capacity-act-cap-177a">45. Proceedings under the Mental Capacity Act (Cap 177A)</h2>

<p>Any application under the Mental Capacity Act made in relation to any proceedings
commenced in the High Court under Part I of the Mental Disorders and Treatment Act (Cap.
178) shall be heard and determined by the Family Division of the High Court.</p>

<h2 id="46-documents-to-be-filed">46. Documents to be filed</h2>

<p>(1) The originating summons and supporting affidavits for mental capacity proceedings are
to be filed in the Family Justice Courts.</p>

<p>(2) The Court may reject any document filed if there are errors or if the document does not
comply with the Family Justice Rules, these Practice Directions, or any other directions
made by the Court.</p>

<p>(3) Explanatory text in Form 217 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions should be
excluded from the originating summons. Also, where a choice is set out in the form
(e.g. Deputy / Deputies), the inapplicable choice should be deleted.</p>

<h2 id="47-where-permission-is-not-required-to-make-an-application">47. Where permission is not required to make an application</h2>

<p>(1) The definition of “P” in rule 175 of the Family Justice Rules shall be applicable in these
Practice Directions. “P” means a person who lacks or, so far as consistent with the
context, is alleged to lack capacity (within the meaning of the Mental Capacity Act) and
to whom any proceedings under the Mental Capacity Act (Cap. 177A) relate.</p>

<p>(2) If the plaintiff or applicant falls or believes himself to fall within the categories of
persons who do not require permission to file an application, this shall be stated in the
supporting affidavit. Relevant documents, such as copies of birth certificates or
marriage certificates, of the lasting powers of attorney or of the court orders appointing
the deputies shall be exhibited to support the averment that no permission is required
for an application under the Mental Capacity Act.</p>

<h2 id="48-where-permission-is-required-to-make-an-application">48. Where permission is required to make an application</h2>

<p>(1) Apart from the categories listed in section 38 of the Mental Capacity Act (Cap. 177A),
permission is required for an application to the Court under the Mental Capacity Act.</p>

<p>(2) Where permission is required, that prayer may be included in the main application itself.
There is no requirement for a separate application for permission. The grounds upon
which the plaintiff or applicant is relying to obtain such permission must be stated
clearly in the supporting affidavit. The Court will decide whether to grant such
permission based on the grounds relied upon by the plaintiff or applicant.</p>

<h2 id="49-service-of-application-on-named-defendants-and-relevant-persons">49. Service of application on named defendants and relevant persons</h2>

<p>(1) Rule 179 of the Family Justice Rules requires the plaintiff to serve the application,
together with each affidavit or other document filed in support of the application, on
each person named as a defendant in the proceedings and on each relevant person.</p>

<p>(2) In a situation where there are no named defendants, the application shall still be served
on relevant persons.</p>

<p>(3) Service on a named defendant shall be by way of personal service. Service on relevant
persons may be by way of ordinary service pursuant to rule 902 of the Family Justice
Rules, unless directed otherwise by the Court.</p>

<p>(4) Where a relevant person resides overseas and the plaintiff or applicant is able to show
that an electronic mail account to which the document will be sent belongs to the
relevant person to be served and that it is currently active, the Court may permit service
on such a relevant person to be carried out by way of electronic email. The grounds
upon which the plaintiff or applicant is relying to obtain such permission must be stated
clearly in the supporting affidavit,</p>

<p>(5) Subject to the timelines specified under rule 179(2) of the Family Justice Rules, one
affidavit of service may be filed in respect of service on all the named defendants and
relevant persons in any application. The dates, times and manner of service for each of
the named defendants and relevant persons have to be stated clearly in the affidavit of
service.</p>

<h2 id="50-relevant-persons">50. Relevant persons</h2>

<p>(1) “Relevant persons” are persons who have an involvement in P’s life and/or who are
likely to have an interest in the application. Often, P’s immediate family members, by
virtue of their relationship to P, are likely to have an interest in being notified that an
application has been made to the Court concerning P.</p>

<p>(2) ‘Relevant persons’ for the purposes of Rule 179 of the Family Justice Rules will
therefore often include the following immediate family members:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) P’s spouse;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) P’s children (aged 21 and above);
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) P’s parents or guardians; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(d) P’s brothers or sisters (aged 21 and above).
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(3) However, the presumption that immediate family members are likely to have an interest
in an application concerning P may be rebutted where the plaintiff or applicant is aware
of circumstances which reasonably indicate that P’s immediate family should not be
served. For example, where the family member in question has had little or no
involvement in P’s life and has shown no inclination to do so, that family member need
not be served. In some cases, P may be closer to persons who are not immediate family
members and if so, it will be appropriate to effect service on them instead of the
immediate family members.</p>

<p>(4) The plaintiff or applicant should serve the application, the supporting affidavits and the
Notice to Relevant Person in Form 222 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions on
relevant persons.</p>

<p>(5) Where the plaintiff or applicant decides that a person listed in one of the categories in
sub-paragraph (2) ought to be served, and there are other persons in that category (for
example, P has three siblings), the plaintiff or applicant should serve on all persons
falling within that category unless there is a good reason not to do so. For example, it
may be a good reason not to serve on every person in the category if one or more of
them has had little or no involvement in P’s life and has shown no inclination to do so.</p>

<p>(6) Apart from immediate family members, other relevant persons who are likely to have
an interest in the application concerning P and who should be served the application,
the supporting affidavits and the Notice to Relevant Person in Form 222 in Appendix
A to these Practice Directions include:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) any other relatives or friends who have a close relationship with P;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) any person who has a legal duty to support P;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) any person who will benefit from P’s estate; and
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(d) any person who is responsible for P’s care.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>If there is no such person to the best of the plaintiff’s or applicant’s knowledge, he is to
state this in his supporting affidavit.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(7) The details of all relevant persons who should be served are to be listed clearly in the
supporting affidavit of the plaintiff or applicant. Where service would not be effected
on relevant persons who should be served, the reason why this is so must be stated in
the supporting affidavit.</p>

<p>(8) In cases where P has had severe intellectual disability since early childhood and where
P’s parents are P’s sole caregivers and where P is now no longer a minor and P’s parents
need to be authorised to continue to look after P’s affairs, P’s parents would normally
be the only relevant persons for the purposes of the application but the applicants must
provide sufficient information to enable the Court to reach the conclusion that there are
no other relevant persons.</p>

<p>(9) Organisations providing residential accommodation to P</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) If P resides at an organisation providing residential accommodation (regardless
of whether it also provides care or treatment to P), the plaintiff or applicant shall
serve the application, the supporting affidavits and the Notice to Relevant
Person in Form 222 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions on such an
organisation as soon as possible and in any event, not more than 2 working days
after the application has been filed. For the purposes of the application, the
organisation providing residential accommodation to P shall be considered a
relevant person. However, the plaintiff or applicant need not obtain the consent
of such an organisation to the application.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) If the organisation providing residential accommodation to P wishes to furnish
any relevant information for the Court’s consideration and determination of the
application in the best interests of P, it shall notify the Court within 8 days after
the date on which the organisation is served with the application. If such a
notification is submitted, the Court may require and direct for the submission of
a report and/or attendance of the maker of the report at the hearing of the
application.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) If an applicant has a strong reason for not serving an affidavit or any other
document (other than the originating summons) on the organisation providing
residential accommodation to P, the applicant may file a summons to seek
dispensation of service of such documents on the organisation in question.
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="51-consent-of-relevant-persons">51. Consent of relevant persons</h2>

<p>(1) If any relevant person to be served has consented to the application and to dispensation
of service, the plaintiff or applicant shall file the consent of the relevant person in Form
221 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions together with the application. The
consent given by the relevant person to the application and to dispensation of service
must be attested by a solicitor, a Commissioner for Oaths, a notary public or any person
for the time being authorised by law in the place where the document is executed to
administer oaths.</p>

<p>(2) The Court may dispense with the service of the application on the relevant person on
the application of the plaintiff or applicant. It should be stated clearly in the supporting
affidavit that such relevant persons have given their consent to the application and to
the dispensation of service.</p>

<h2 id="52-notification-of-p">52. Notification of P</h2>

<p>(1) In all cases of notification, the person effecting notification must provide P with the
information required under rule 181 of Family Justice Rules in a way that is appropriate
to P’s circumstances (for example, using simple language, visual aids or any other
appropriate means).</p>

<p>(2) The certificate of notification filed under rule 181(5) of the Family Justice Rules shall
be in Form 223 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions.</p>

<p>(3) Under the Mental Capacity Act, notification of P shall be the norm rather than the
exception. However, in certain appropriate circumstances, the person required to notify
P may apply to Court for an order to dispense with the requirement to notify P. Such an
application would be appropriate where, for example, P is in a permanent vegetative
state or a minimally conscious state, or where notification is likely to cause significant
and disproportionate distress to P. The reasons for seeking dispensation of notification
shall be stated in the supporting affidavit of the plaintiff or applicant.</p>

<h2 id="53-responding-to-an-application">53. Responding to an application</h2>

<p>(1) If a relevant person served with an application wishes to object to the application or any
part of it, he must apply to the Court to be joined as a party to the proceedings within
21 days after the date on which he was served with the application. The application to
be joined as a party to the proceedings shall be in Form 4 in Appendix A to these
Practice Directions and be supported by an affidavit stating his interest in the
application and the grounds of his objection.</p>

<p>(2) If a relevant person served with an application consents to the application, his written
consent must be attested by a solicitor, a Commissioner for Oaths, a notary public or
any person for the time being authorised by law in the place where the document is
executed to administer oaths and must be in Form 221 in Appendix A to these Practice
Directions. The written consent should be filed by the plaintiff or applicant within 21
days after the date on which the relevant person was served with the application.</p>

<p>(3) Where a person who was not served with any application (whether listed as a relevant
person or otherwise in the supporting affidavit of the plaintiff or applicant) wishes to
be heard in the proceedings, he must apply to be joined as a party to the proceedings in
Form 4 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions.</p>

<h2 id="54-applications-involving-the-appointment-of-deputies">54. Applications involving the appointment of deputies</h2>

<p><strong>The prayers</strong></p>

<p>(1) The originating summons to be filed for the appointment of a deputy or deputies shall
be in Form 217 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions.</p>

<p>(2) It must be stated clearly in the originating summons whether the declaration sought in
respect of P’s lack of capacity concerns either P’s personal welfare or P’s property and
affairs or both.</p>

<p>(3) The plaintiff or applicant should ensure that the originating summons, the supporting
affidavit and the doctor’s affidavit exhibiting the medical report are consistent as to
whether P lacks capacity in relation to his personal welfare or his property and affairs
or both.</p>

<p>(4) If there is more than one deputy sought to be appointed, the originating summons must
state whether the deputies are to act jointly or jointly and severally.</p>

<p>(5) The powers sought for the deputies are to be drafted appropriately to suit the purpose
of each application.</p>

<p>(6) Any other specific orders or reliefs that are required on the particular facts of each case

<p>(7) The affidavit to be filed by the plaintiff or applicant and all proposed deputies in
support of the application for the appointment of a deputy or deputies shall be in Form
218 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions.</p>

<p>(8) In the case of applications for direct payment of P’s hospital and/or nursing home
charges from P’s funds or P’s insurance and where no deputy is to be appointed, the
affidavit to be filed by the plaintiff or applicant in support of the application shall be in
Form 219 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions.</p>

<p>(8A) If there is more than one plaintiff or applicant or proposed deputy, a single affidavit
should be made by all the plaintiffs, applicants or proposed deputies. The plaintiffs,
applicants or proposed deputies should not file separate supporting affidavits.</p>

<p>(8B) The following search results must be exhibited in the supporting affidavit:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) Office of the Public Guardian search result showing if P has registered a Lasting
Power of Attorney;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) Office of the Public Guardian search result showing if there is a past Mental
Capacity Act or Mental Disorders And Treatment Act Order in respect of P; and
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) Wills Registry search result showing if P has registered a Will.
</code></pre>

<p>(9) In order to assist the Court, the medical report shall —</p>

given to the doctor and those that are based on the doctor’s examination of P;

the report and it should contain sufficient information to justify the doctor’s opinions
and conclusions.</p>

<p><strong>The affidavit by the successor deputy or deputies</strong></p>

<p>(10) If the plaintiff or applicant seeks to apply for the appointment of a successor deputy or
deputies, the application must also be accompanied by an affidavit of the proposed
successor deputy or deputies in Form 220 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions.</p>

<p>(2) If an application under sub-paragraph (1) is filed more than 6 months from the date of
the order, the application must be served personally on every party to the proceedings.
If such an application is filed 6 months or less from the date of the order, the service on
every party to the proceedings may be by way of ordinary service. Service of an
application under sub-paragraph (1) on every relevant person shall be by way of

the relevant person(s) may be given in a manner provided for by Paragraph 49(4) of
these Practice Directions.</p>

<p>(3) All applications together with the supporting affidavit shall be served on the Public

originating summons and supported by an affidavit.</p>

<p>(2) If the plaintiff or applicant knows or has reason to believe that the donor lacks capacity,
he shall notify the donor in accordance with rule 181 of the Family Justice Rules and

<h2 id="57-application-for-statutory-wills">57. Application for statutory wills</h2>

<h2 id="58-litigation-representative-in-mental-capacity-proceedings">58. Litigation Representative in mental capacity proceedings</h2>

<p>(1) Where P is a party to any mental capacity proceedings with a litigation representative,
P should be referred to in the proceedings as “P (by A.B., his litigation representative)”.</p>

<p>(2) The application to be the litigation representative of P shall be in Form 4 in Appendix
A to these Practice Directions. The supporting affidavit must satisfy the Court of the
matters set out in rule 184(5)(a) of the Family Justice Rules.</p>

<p>(3) Under rule 184(2) of the Family Justice Rules, the Court may, on its own motion or on

184(5)(a) of the Rules of Court.</p>

<h2 id="59-where-p-ceases-to-lack-capacity-or-dies">59. Where P ceases to lack capacity or dies</h2>

<p>(1) Where P ceases to lack capacity or dies, steps may need to be taken to finalise the
court’s involvement in P’s affairs.</p>

<p><strong>Application to end proceedings</strong></p>

<p>(2) Where P ceases to lack capacity in relation to the matter or matters to which the
proceedings relate, an application may be made by any of the following people to the
Court to end the proceedings and discharge any orders made in respect of that person:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) P;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) his litigation representative; or

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) any other person who is a party to the proceedings.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(3) The application should be supported by evidence that P no longer lacks capacity to
make decisions in relation to the matter or matters to which the proceedings relate.</p>

<p><strong>Applications where proceedings have concluded</strong></p>

<p>(4) Where P ceases to lack capacity after proceedings have concluded, an application may
be made to the Court to discharge any orders made (including an order appointing a
deputy or an order in relation to security).</p>

<p>(5) The affidavit filed in support should exhibit the orders sought to be discharged and
contain evidence that P no longer lacks capacity to make decisions in relation to the
matter or matters to which the proceedings relate.</p>

<p><strong>Procedure to be followed when P dies</strong></p>

or discharging the security) may be made following P’s death. The application should
be supported by an affidavit exhibiting a copy of P’s death certificate.</p>

<p><strong>Final report by deputy</strong></p>

<p>(7) The Public Guardian may require a deputy to submit a final report upon P ceasing to
lack capacity or P’s death. If security has been ordered by the Court, the Court must be
satisfied that the Public Guardian either does not require a final report or is satisfied
with the final report provided by the deputy before the said security can be discharged.</p>

(1) The Duty Judge at the Family Courts may hear an urgent application on Saturdays (from
1pm to 6pm) and on Sundays and public holidays (from 9am to 6pm) under the
following circumstances:

```
(a) where the applicant, being a lawful guardian or parent of a child, is seeking to
restrain or enjoin another party from taking the child out of jurisdiction without
the consent of the applicant;
```
```
(b) the child’s departure from Singapore is so imminent that it would be too late for
the application to be heard on the next working day; and
```
```
(c) there is a strong likelihood that the child, once taken out of Singapore, will not
return to Singapore.
```
(2) To request the urgent hearing of such an application, the applicant should contact the
Weekend / Public Holiday Duty Registrar at 97241402 during the following operating
hours:

```
(a) 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays; and
```
```
(b) 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sundays and public holidays.
```
(3) The Duty Registrar will only arrange for the hearing of the application before the Duty
Judge if the applicant satisfies the Duty Registrar that the case meets all the criteria
stipulated in sub-paragraph (1).

(4) If the applicant is unable to file the application and supporting affidavits via the
electronic filing service (EFS) before the hearing, he / she must give a signed written
undertaking to the Court to do so in accordance with Form 259 in Appendix A to these
Practice Directions before the application will be heard. The applicant must bring three
copies each of the application, the supporting affidavit and the appropriate draft orders
of court (Form 260 in Appendix B to these Practice Directions) for the ex parte hearing.

(5) On an ex parte application for an injunction against the permanent removal of a child
from Singapore, the Court would require the applicant, to give an undertaking to
compensate any party for any loss caused as a result of the application. The Court may
require the undertaking as to damages to be supported by —

```
(a) making payment into Court;
```

```
(b) furnishing a banker's guarantee; or
```
```
(c) making payment to the applicant's solicitor to be held by the solicitor as an
officer of the Court pending further order.
```
(6) An applicant for an order under section 14 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122)
must prepare the following documents in accordance with the appropriate forms in
Appendix A to these Practice Directions and bring them along to the hearing:

```

Directions);
```
```
(b) the Writ for Seizure (Form 262 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions);

Directions);
```
```
(d) the applicant’s letter of undertaking to indemnify the Family Justice Courts and
the Bailiff against any liabilities or claims that may arise from or in connection
with the execution of the order granted by the Court to the applicant (Form 264

execution and to pay the costs, expenses and charges of execution should the
same not be fully paid by the applicant (Form 266 in Appendix A to these
Practice Directions)
```
(7) The forms in Appendix A to these Practice Directions are intended to make it easier for
persons served with the relevant orders to understand what the orders mean. These
standard form orders should be used save to the extent that an applicant is of the view
that the form should be varied and the Duty Judge hearing a particular application
considers that there is a good reason for adopting a different form. Any departure from
the terms of the standard forms must be justified by the applicant in his / her supporting
affidavit(s).

(8) If an order is granted under section 14 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122), the
applicant must do the following:

Practice Directions.

and/or decision.

(7) A solicitor who wishes to attend before a Duty Registrar and to refer him to documents
filed using the Electronic Filing Service must either —

```
(a) file the document sufficiently far in advance before attending before the Duty
Registrar such that the documents are already included in the electronic case file

```

```
attend before the Duty Registrar after they have received notification from the
Court that the document has been accepted); or
```
```
(b) attend before the Duty Registrar with the paper documents, if these exist (and in
this regard, the Duty Registrar will require the solicitor to give an undertaking
to file all the documents by the next working day after the attendance before
dealing with the matter).
```
(8) Solicitors should register at the relevant Family Registry counter prior to attending

sale and transfer of matrimonial assets. These orders fall into two categories:

further notice to the party whom the Registrar is signing the documents on behalf
of (“Category A orders”); and
```
```
(b) an order empowering the Registrar to sign the relevant documents only in the
event of a default by a party in signing the relevant documents (“the other party”)
despite written notification to him/her to sign the relevant documents (“Category
B orders”).
```
(12) Applications to obtain the signature of the Registrar pursuant to Category A orders and
Category B orders shall be made before the Duty Registrar in the Family Justice

```
(14) The sealed copy of the order of court empowering the Registrar to sign will be returned
after the signing of the documents.


## 160. Attendance of solicitors in Court

(1) Save in the most exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, and so long as the firm of
solicitors remains on record, a member of the firm must attend all proceedings in respect
of the cause or matter in which the firm is acting, even if it does not intend to oppose
the orders sought by the other side. The practice of asking the opposing solicitor to
mention the matter on one's behalf is also not acceptable and should be discouraged.

(2) All solicitors appearing in any cause or matter are to be punctual in attending Court as
delay in commencement of hearing leads to wastage of judicial time. Appropriate
sanctions may be imposed for late attendances.


## 161. Use of Skype

(1) The Family Justice Courts will allow solicitors to use Skype, a free and accessible
service, to mention _ex-parte_ applications and/or cases in which parties have a consent
order.

(2) This will enable solicitors to mention their cases via Skype instead of personally
attending Court for many short mentions which generally will not last beyond 10
minutes.

**_Guidelines and Procedures_**
(3) Solicitors mentioning their cases via Skype must comply with the guidelines and
procedures set out in the Annex to this Paragraph (see below).

**_Court etiquette_**
(4) A solicitor mentioning a case via Skype must proceed with the hearing as if he or she
were appearing before the Judge in person, and must comply with all Court rules of
etiquette as prescribed in these Practice Directions and any relevant Registrar’s Circular.

**_Adjournment of Skype hearing_**
(5) If for any reason the presiding Judge or Registrar considers that it is not expedient for
any hearing to continue via Skype, he or she may –

```
(a) adjourn the matter and require parties to attend Court personally on an appointed
date and time;
```
```
(b) conduct the hearing via telephone; or
```
```
(c) make any other direction that may be appropriate in the circumstances of the
case.
```
**_Hearing Records_**
(6) Hearings conducted via Skype shall not be recorded on video or audio tape or any other
form.

**_Queries and Assistance_**
(7) Any queries or requests for assistance pertaining to Skype hearings may be sent to
FJCourts_Family_Registry@fjcourts.gov.sg.

it deems appropriate.

sworn in before the judge hearing the proceeding before they may provide
interpretation services for proceedings in Court.

<p>(1) The Duty Judge at the Family Courts may hear an urgent application on Saturdays (from
1pm to 6pm) and on Sundays and public holidays (from 9am to 6pm) under the
following circumstances:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) where the applicant, being a lawful guardian or parent of a child, is seeking to
restrain or enjoin another party from taking the child out of jurisdiction without
the consent of the applicant;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) the child’s departure from Singapore is so imminent that it would be too late for
the application to be heard on the next working day; and

</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) there is a strong likelihood that the child, once taken out of Singapore, will not
return to Singapore.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(2) To request the urgent hearing of such an application, the applicant should contact the
Weekend / Public Holiday Duty Registrar at 97241402 during the following operating
hours:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays; and
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sundays and public holidays.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(3) The Duty Registrar will only arrange for the hearing of the application before the Duty
Judge if the applicant satisfies the Duty Registrar that the case meets all the criteria
stipulated in sub-paragraph (1).</p>

<p>(4) If the applicant is unable to file the application and supporting affidavits via the
electronic filing service (EFS) before the hearing, he / she must give a signed written
undertaking to the Court to do so in accordance with Form 259 in Appendix A to these
Practice Directions before the application will be heard. The applicant must bring three
copies each of the application, the supporting affidavit and the appropriate draft orders
of court (Form 260 in Appendix B to these Practice Directions) for the ex parte hearing.</p>

<p>(5) On an ex parte application for an injunction against the permanent removal of a child
from Singapore, the Court would require the applicant, to give an undertaking to
compensate any party for any loss caused as a result of the application. The Court may
require the undertaking as to damages to be supported by —</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) making payment into Court;
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) furnishing a banker's guarantee; or

</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) making payment to the applicant's solicitor to be held by the solicitor as an
officer of the Court pending further order.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(6) An applicant for an order under section 14 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122)
must prepare the following documents in accordance with the appropriate forms in
Appendix A to these Practice Directions and bring them along to the hearing:</p>

with the execution of the order granted by the Court to the applicant (Form 264

</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(e) the applicant’s letter of undertaking to pay compensation / damages and to serve

execution and to pay the costs, expenses and charges of execution should the
same not be fully paid by the applicant (Form 266 in Appendix A to these

</div>
<p>(7) The forms in Appendix A to these Practice Directions are intended to make it easier for
persons served with the relevant orders to understand what the orders mean. These
standard form orders should be used save to the extent that an applicant is of the view
that the form should be varied and the Duty Judge hearing a particular application
considers that there is a good reason for adopting a different form. Any departure from
the terms of the standard forms must be justified by the applicant in his / her supporting
affidavit(s).</p>

<p>(8) If an order is granted under section 14 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122), the
applicant must do the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) accompany the Bailiff to the place of execution and identify the child to be

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(d) engage and pay for the costs of an auxiliary police officer to accompany the

<p>(4) Only solicitors (or, where a party is not represented, a litigant in person) shall appear
before the Duty Registrar.</p>

<p>(5) Except where the attendance of the advocate and solicitor is required under sub-
paragraph (9), the filing of the relevant documents will be sufficient for the Duty
Registrar’s disposal of any application or matter. Documents which are filed using the
Electronic Filing Service will be returned to the solicitor through the Electronic Filing
Service to the inbox of the law firm’s computer system or through the service bureau.
Documents which are not electronically filed shall be collected from the relevant Family
Registry not earlier than one clear day after the documents have been filed.</p>

<p>(6) All documents which are not required to be filed using the Electronic Filing Service
should be duly stamped before presentation to the Duty Registrar for his signature
and/or decision.</p>

<p>(7) A solicitor who wishes to attend before a Duty Registrar and to refer him to documents
filed using the Electronic Filing Service must either —</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) file the document sufficiently far in advance before attending before the Duty
Registrar such that the documents are already included in the electronic case file
for the Duty Registrar’s reference (and in this regard, solicitors should only

</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) attend before the Duty Registrar with the paper documents, if these exist (and in

</div>
<p>(8) Solicitors should register at the relevant Family Registry counter prior to attending
before the Duty Registrar.</p>

</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) when an application or document is returned with the direction “Solicitor to

</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) when so required by any provision of law.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(10) A solicitor may, if he wishes to expedite matters, attend before the Duty Registrar even
if his attendance is not ordinarily required.</p>

<p>(11) When dealing with the ancillary matters, the Court may grant orders under section 31

sale and transfer of matrimonial assets. These orders fall into two categories:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) an order empowering the Registrar to sign the relevant documents without

<p>(12) Applications to obtain the signature of the Registrar pursuant to Category A orders and
Category B orders shall be made before the Duty Registrar in the Family Justice
Courts. The documents to be signed by the Duty Registrar shall contain the following
endorsements:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>“Signed on behalf of {insert name of party in default} by Registrar, Family
Justice Courts, pursuant to order of court dated {insert date}”

<h2 id="160-attendance-of-solicitors-in-court">160. Attendance of solicitors in Court</h2>

<p>(1) Save in the most exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, and so long as the firm of
solicitors remains on record, a member of the firm must attend all proceedings in respect
of the cause or matter in which the firm is acting, even if it does not intend to oppose
the orders sought by the other side. The practice of asking the opposing solicitor to
mention the matter on one’s behalf is also not acceptable and should be discouraged.</p>

<p>(2) All solicitors appearing in any cause or matter are to be punctual in attending Court as
delay in commencement of hearing leads to wastage of judicial time. Appropriate
sanctions may be imposed for late attendances.</p>

<h2 id="161-use-of-skype">161. Use of Skype</h2>

<p>(1) The Family Justice Courts will allow solicitors to use Skype, a free and accessible
service, to mention <em>ex-parte</em> applications and/or cases in which parties have a consent
order.</p>

<p>(2) This will enable solicitors to mention their cases via Skype instead of personally
attending Court for many short mentions which generally will not last beyond 10
minutes.</p>

<p><strong><em>Guidelines and Procedures</em></strong>
(3) Solicitors mentioning their cases via Skype must comply with the guidelines and
procedures set out in the Annex to this Paragraph (see below).</p>

<p><strong><em>Court etiquette</em></strong>
(4) A solicitor mentioning a case via Skype must proceed with the hearing as if he or she
were appearing before the Judge in person, and must comply with all Court rules of
etiquette as prescribed in these Practice Directions and any relevant Registrar’s Circular.</p>

<p><strong><em>Adjournment of Skype hearing</em></strong>
(5) If for any reason the presiding Judge or Registrar considers that it is not expedient for
any hearing to continue via Skype, he or she may –</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) adjourn the matter and require parties to attend Court personally on an appointed
date and time;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) conduct the hearing via telephone; or
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(c) make any other direction that may be appropriate in the circumstances of the
case.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><strong><em>Hearing Records</em></strong>
(6) Hearings conducted via Skype shall not be recorded on video or audio tape or any other
form.</p>

<p><strong><em>Queries and Assistance</em></strong>
(7) Any queries or requests for assistance pertaining to Skype hearings may be sent to

out the reasons for the other parties’ objections, or explain why the consent of one or</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>more of the other parties cannot be obtained. Any relevant correspondence between the
parties should also be annexed. The Court will then evaluate the contents of the request

information relating to both court cases must be stated in the request:</p>

paragraph (3) and (4), it is also liable to be rejected.</p>

<p>(12) All correspondence to Court relating to or in connection with any pending matter shall
be copied to all other parties in the matter or to their solicitors unless there are good

to all requests for interpretation services of interpreters from the Supreme Court’s
Interpreters Section, whether the services are required for hearings in open Court or in
Chambers.</p>

<p>(3) Not less than 7 working days before the day on which the services of an interpreter are
required (“scheduled day”), the requesting party must file a Request addressed to the
appropriate Head Interpreter through the Electronic Filing Service and attach Form 2 of
Appendix A of the Supreme Court Practice Directions in Portable Document Format
(PDF) to the Request in electronic form.</p>

<p>(4) The Request in sub-paragraph (3) must be filed for hearings of matters which have been
adjourned or part-heard, even if the services of an interpreter were requested and
provided at an earlier hearing of the same matter. In the event that a Request is made in
respect of an adjourned or part-heard matter, the Request should also state the date of
the earlier hearing in addition to the scheduled day.</p>

<p>(5) The requesting party shall make payment of any prescribed fee for interpretation
services under the Family Justice Rules upon approval of the Request.</p>

<p>(6) In the event that the services of the interpreter are for any reason not required on any of
the scheduled days specified in the Request, the requesting party shall immediately
notify the appropriate Head Interpreter either by letter, facsimile transmission or email.
This shall serve as a notice of cancellation.</p>

<p>(7) Any request for refund of the fee paid under sub-paragraph (5) must be submitted to the
Registrar through the Electronic Filing Service within one month from the date on
which the reason for the refund arose. The supporting reasons and the amount of refund

<p>(9) The provision of interpretation services by the Supreme Court’s Interpreters Section is
subject to the availability of suitable interpreters on the day that the interpretation</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>services are required. Failure to comply with the directions set out in sub-paragraphs
(3) to (5) may result in the services of interpreters not being available or provided.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(10) Engagement of private interpreters (i.e. interpreters not from the Supreme Court’s
Interpreters Section):
(a) For the avoidance of doubt, a party may engage the services of a private
interpreter for interpretation services in respect of the languages listed in Form
2 of Appendix A of the Supreme Court Practice Directions.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) If a party requires the services of an interpreter in a language apart from those

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) within 7 working days from the date of the case conference or other proceeding
at which the hearing date was fixed; or

</div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(b) 2 weeks before the day when the interpreter is required,

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>whichever is earlier. This practice is to be followed for all fresh and adjourned hearings,
whether in open Court or in Chambers.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(13) Where an interpreter is required and the Registrar has not been so informed, any
deployment of an interpreter will be subject to availability.</p>

<p>(14) The Request should contain the following information:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(a) the Case number;

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(h) the language/dialect spoken by the witnesses requiring the services of the
interpreter.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(15) Where the services of the interpreter requested are no longer required prior to the start
of the hearing, such as in the event of a settlement prior to the hearing, the party who
has requested the services of the interpreter must inform the Registrar in writing
immediately.</p>

<p>(16) For proceedings other than proceedings under Parts VII and VIII of the Women’s
Charter (Cap. 353), the requesting party must file the request for the services of an
interpreter through a “Request for Hearing Administrative Support” through the
Electronic Filing Service.</p>

<p>(17) Engagement of private interpreters (i.e. interpreters not from the Family Courts’
Interpreters Section):
(a) If a party requires the services of an interpreter in a language apart from Chinese,

The assigned Judge will\ninform parties and their lawyers of preferred modes of communication but in all cases,\nthe general approach is through emails to the generic email address of the Family Justice\nCourts.</p>\n\n<p>(18) All communications with Court should be confined to routine procedural,\nadministrative or procedural matters. Communications should never, unless this is\ninvited, contain information or allegations which are material to the substantive issues\nin the litigation or which are intended to influence any decision of substance to be made\nby the assigned Judge.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"7-guidance-on-direct-judicial-communications-in-international-family-proceedings-affecting-children\">7.

The current appointees are set out in\nthe Annex to this Paragraph (please see below).</p>\n\n<p>(3) Matters which may be the subject of direct judicial communications include, for\nexample:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) scheduling the case in the foreign jurisdiction:\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(i) to make interim orders, eg, support, measure of protection;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(ii) to ensure the availability of expedited hearings;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(b) establishing whether protective measures are available for the child or other\nparent in the jurisdiction to which the child would be returned in the case of a\nchild abduction case and, in an appropriate case, ensuring the available\nprotective measures are in place in that jurisdiction before a return is ordered;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(c) ascertaining whether the foreign court can accept and enforce undertakings\noffered by the parties in the initiating jurisdiction;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(d) ascertaining whether the foreign court can issue a mirror order (ie, same order\nin both jurisdictions);\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(e) confirming whether orders were made by the foreign court;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(f) verifying whether findings about domestic violence were made by the foreign\ncourt;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(g) verifying whether a transfer of jurisdiction is appropriate.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>(4) “Central Authority” in this Practice Direction is the Authority appointed under section\n5 of the International Child Abduction Act (Cap 143C).</p>\n\n<p>(5) For the avoidance of doubt, all references to “parties” or their “representatives” shall,\nwhere a child is to be separately represented, include the Child Representative as\nappointed by the Court under the Family Justice Rules.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Overarching Principles</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>(6) Every judge engaging in direct judicial communications must respect the law of his or\nher jurisdiction.</p>\n\n<p>(7) When communicating, each judge seised of the matter should maintain his or her\nindependence in reaching his or her own decision on the matter at issue.</p>\n\n<p>(8) Communications must not compromise the independence of the judge seised in\nreaching his or her own decision on the matter at issue. Any discussion about the merits\nof the case should be avoided.</p>\n\n<p>(9) For the avoidance of doubt, parties remain entitled under the <em>Rules of Court</em> to call upon\nexpert witnesses to prove or disprove the foreign law. The Court will take into account\nall the available evidence before arriving at a decision.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Procedure and Safeguards</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>(10) Either party to the proceeding may raise with the judge the desirability and need for\ndirect judicial communications.</p>\n\n<p>(11) A judge seised of the matter may, if he or she determines it desirable, initiate direct\njudicial communication through the Liaison Judges.</p>\n\n<p>(12) Before deciding whether to engage in direct judicial communications, the judge should\nconsider:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) whether there is a question of foreign law or procedure to clarify with a judge\nin the foreign jurisdiction,\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(b) whether the question can be answered or dealt with by the Central Authority in\nSingapore or the Central Authority in the foreign jurisdiction, and if so, the\njudge may consider having the Central Authority address the issue or obtain the\ninformation, and\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(c) whether the question can be answered or dealt with by any judge in the foreign\njurisdiction (other than the judge hearing the proceeding).\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>(13) The following are commonly accepted procedural safeguards.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) Except in special circumstances, parties are to be notified of the nature of the\nproposed communication;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(b) A record is to be kept of communications and it is to be made available to the\nparties;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(c) Any conclusions reached between the judges should be in writing and made\navailable to parties;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(d) Parties or their representatives should have the opportunity to be present in\ncertain cases, for example via conference call facilities.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>(14) The above commonly accepted procedural safeguards should be adopted subject to\nSingapore’s legislation and rules.</p>\n\n<p>(15) In special or urgent circumstances where parties were not notified in advance of the\nnature of the proposed communications, the judge should provide written reasons to the\nparties as to why there was no notification as soon as practicable.</p>\n\n<p>(16) If any party objects to the proposed communications, the judge should direct\nsubmissions be lodged from all parties, and if necessary, should direct an oral hearing,\nbefore ruling on the matter, giving short reasons for such ruling.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Initiating the Communication</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>(17) In considering whether the use of direct judicial communications is appropriate, the\njudge should have regard to speed, efficiency and cost-effectiveness.</p>\n\n<p>(18) Judges should consider the benefit of direct judicial communications and at what stage\nof the proceeding it should occur. The timing of the communication is for the judge\nwho initiates it to consider.</p>\n\n<p>(19) The initial communication should ordinarily take place between our Liaison Judge and\nthe Liaison Judge of the other jurisdiction, if any, in order to ascertain the identity of\nthe judge seised in that jurisdiction. If no Liaison Judge has been appointed in the other\njurisdiction, the Central Authority of Singapore or the party within jurisdiction is to\nassist in providing the identity of the judge in the other jurisdiction.</p>\n\n<p>(20) When making contact with a judge in another jurisdiction, the initial communication\nshould normally be in writing sent to the email address in the Annex below, subject to\nprovisions set out in this Practice Direction in relation to written communications, and\nshould in particular identify:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) the name and contact details of the initiating judge;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(b) the nature of the case (with due regard to confidentiality concerns);\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(c) the issue(s) on which communication is sought;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(d) whether the parties before the judge initiating the communication have\nconsented to judicial communication;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(e) when the communication may occur (with due regard to time differences);\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(f) any specific questions which the judge initiating the communication would like\nanswered;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(g) any other pertinent matters.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>(21) The time and place for communications between the courts should be to the satisfaction\nof both courts.</p>\n\n<p>(22) Personnel other than judges in each court may communicate fully with each other to\nestablish appropriate arrangements for the communication without the necessity for\nparticipation of counsel unless otherwise directed by either of the courts.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>The Form of Communications and Language Difficulties</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>(23) Judges should use the most appropriate technological facilities in order to communicate\nas efficiently and as swiftly as possible.</p>\n\n<p>(24) The initial method and language of communication should, as far as possible, respect\nthe preferences, if any, indicated by the intended recipient in the list of members of the\nLiaison Judges. Further communications should be carried out using the initial method\nand language of communication unless otherwise agreed by the judges concerned.</p>\n\n<p>(25) Where two judges do not understand a common language, and translation or\ninterpretation services are required, such services could be provided by the court or the\nCentral Authority in the country from which the communication is initiated.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Written Communications</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>(26) Written communications, particularly in initiating the contact, are valuable as they\nprovide for a record of the communication and help alleviate language and time zone\nbarriers.</p>\n\n<p>(27) Where the written communication is provided through translation, it is good practice\nalso to provide the message in its original language.</p>\n\n<p>(28) Communications should always include the name, title and contact details of the sender.</p>\n\n<p>(29) Communications should be written in simple terms, taking into account the language\nskills of the recipient.</p>\n\n<p>(30) As far as possible, appropriate measures should be taken for the personal information\nof the parties to be kept confidential.</p>\n\n<p>(31) Written communications should be transmitted using the most rapid and efficient means\nof communication and, in those cases where it is necessary for confidential data to be\ntransmitted, secured means of communication should be employed.</p>\n\n<p>(32) Written communications should always be acknowledged as soon as possible with an\nindication as to when a response will be provided.</p>\n\n<p>(33) All communications should be typewritten.</p>\n\n<p>(34) Ordinarily, communications should be in writing, save where the paragraph (35)\napplies.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Oral Communications</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>(35) Oral communications are encouraged where judges involved come from jurisdictions\nwhich share the same language.</p>\n\n<p>(36) Where the judges do not speak the same language, one or both of them, subject to an\nagreement between the two judges concerned, should have at their disposal a competent\nand neutral interpreter who can interpret to and from their language.</p>\n\n<p>(37) Where necessary, personal information concerning the parties should be anonymised\nfor the purpose of oral communication.</p>\n\n<p>(38) Oral communications can take place by either telephone or video conference and in\nthose cases where it is necessary that they deal with confidential information, such\ncommunications should be carried out using secured means of communication.</p>\n\n<p>(39) If both judges involved in the communication agree, the parties or their representative\nmay be permitted to be present during the oral communication. If one party or\nrepresentative is to be present, then the other party or representative should be permitted\nto be present.</p>\n\n<p>(40) Subject to the agreement of both judges involved in the oral communications-</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) such oral communications may be conducted in the presence of the parties or\ntheir representatives by way of video conference or by conference telephone\ncall;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(b) the parties or their representatives may be permitted to speak during the\ncommunication, but if one party or representative wishes to speak, then the other\nparty or representative should be permitted a chance to answer.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p><strong><em>Post Communications</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>(41) A written record of the communications should be sent to the parties as soon as\npracticable.</p>\n\n<p>(42) Any correspondence or email or written communications between the judges should be\npreserved for the record.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Keeping Central Authority informed of judicial communications</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>(43) Where appropriate, the judge engaged in direct judicial communications may consider\ninforming his or her Central Authority that a judicial communication will take place.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Annex\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Liaison Judge(s)\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>The Presiding Judge</p>\n\n<p>Family Justice Courts</p>\n\n<p>3 Havelock Square</p>\n\n<p>Singapore 059725</p>\n\n<p>Foo Tuat Yien</p>\n\n<p>Judicial Commissioner</p>\n\n<p>Family Justice Courts</p>\n\n<p>3 Havelock Square</p>\n\n<p>Singapore 059725</p>\n\n<p>Email contact: FJCourts_Family_Registry@fjcourts.gov.sg</p>\n",

Service of application on named defendants and relevant persons</h2>\n\n<p>(1) Rule 179 of the Family Justice Rules requires the plaintiff to serve the application,\ntogether with each affidavit or other document filed in support of the application, on\neach person named as a defendant in the proceedings and on each relevant person.</p>\n\n<p>(2) In a situation where there are no named defendants, the application shall still be served\non relevant persons.</p>\n\n<p>(3) Service on a named defendant shall be by way of personal service. Service on relevant\npersons may be by way of ordinary service pursuant to rule 902 of the Family Justice\nRules, unless directed otherwise by the Court.</p>\n\n<p>(4) Where a relevant person resides overseas and the plaintiff or applicant is able to show\nthat an electronic mail account to which the document will be sent belongs to the\nrelevant person to be served and that it is currently active, the Court may permit service\non such a relevant person to be carried out by way of electronic email. The grounds\nupon which the plaintiff or applicant is relying to obtain such permission must be stated\nclearly in the supporting affidavit,</p>\n\n<p>(5) Subject to the timelines specified under rule 179(2) of the Family Justice Rules, one\naffidavit of service may be filed in respect of service on all the named defendants and\nrelevant persons in any application. The dates, times and manner of service for each of\nthe named defendants and relevant persons have to be stated clearly in the affidavit of\nservice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"50-relevant-persons\">50. Relevant persons</h2>\n\n<p>(1) “Relevant persons” are persons who have an involvement in P’s life and/or who are\nlikely to have an interest in the application. Often, P’s immediate family members, by\nvirtue of their relationship to P, are likely to have an interest in being notified that an\napplication has been made to the Court concerning P.</p>\n\n<p>(2) ‘Relevant persons’ for the purposes of Rule 179 of the Family Justice Rules will\ntherefore often include the following immediate family members:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) P’s spouse;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(b) P’s children (aged 21 and above);\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(c) P’s parents or guardians; and\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(d) P’s brothers or sisters (aged 21 and above).\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>(3) However, the presumption that immediate family members are likely to have an interest\nin an application concerning P may be rebutted where the plaintiff or applicant is aware\nof circumstances which reasonably indicate that P’s immediate family should not be\nserved. For example, where the family member in question has had little or no\ninvolvement in P’s life and has shown no inclination to do so, that family member need\nnot be served. In some cases, P may be closer to persons who are not immediate family\nmembers and if so, it will be appropriate to effect service on them instead of the\nimmediate family members.</p>\n\n<p>(4) The plaintiff or applicant should serve the application, the supporting affidavits and the\nNotice to Relevant Person in Form 222 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions on\nrelevant persons.</p>\n\n<p>(5) Where the plaintiff or applicant decides that a person listed in one of the categories in\nsub-paragraph (2) ought to be served, and there are other persons in that category (for\nexample, P has three siblings), the plaintiff or applicant should serve on all persons\nfalling within that category unless there is a good reason not to do so. For example, it\nmay be a good reason not to serve on every person in the category if one or more of\nthem has had little or no involvement in P’s life and has shown no inclination to do so.</p>\n\n<p>(6) Apart from immediate family members, other relevant persons who are likely to have\nan interest in the application concerning P and who should be served the application,\nthe supporting affidavits and the Notice to Relevant Person in Form 222 in Appendix\nA to these Practice Directions include:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) any other relatives or friends who have a close relationship with P;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(b) any person who has a legal duty to support P;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(c) any person who will benefit from P’s estate; and\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(d) any person who is responsible for P’s care.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>If there is no such person to the best of the plaintiff’s or applicant’s knowledge, he is to\nstate this in his supporting affidavit.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>(7) The details of all relevant persons who should be served are to be listed clearly in the\nsupporting affidavit of the plaintiff or applicant. Where service would not be effected\non relevant persons who should be served, the reason why this is so must be stated in\nthe supporting affidavit.</p>\n\n<p>(8) In cases where P has had severe intellectual disability since early childhood and where\nP’s parents are P’s sole caregivers and where P is now no longer a minor and P’s parents\nneed to be authorised to continue to look after P’s affairs, P’s parents would normally\nbe the only relevant persons for the purposes of the application but the applicants must\nprovide sufficient information to enable the Court to reach the conclusion that there are\nno other relevant persons.</p>\n\n<p>(9) Organisations providing residential accommodation to P</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) If P resides at an organisation providing residential accommodation (regardless\nof whether it also provides care or treatment to P), the plaintiff or applicant shall\nserve the application, the supporting affidavits and the Notice to Relevant\nPerson in Form 222 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions on such an\norganisation as soon as possible and in any event, not more than 2 working days\nafter the application has been filed. For the purposes of the application, the\norganisation providing residential accommodation to P shall be considered a\nrelevant person. However, the plaintiff or applicant need not obtain the consent\nof such an organisation to the application.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(b) If the organisation providing residential accommodation to P wishes to furnish\nany relevant information for the Court’s consideration and determination of the\napplication in the best interests of P, it shall notify the Court within 8 days after\nthe date on which the organisation is served with the application. If such a\nnotification is submitted, the Court may require and direct for the submission of\na report and/or attendance of the maker of the report at the hearing of the\napplication.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(c) If an applicant has a strong reason for not serving an affidavit or any other\ndocument (other than the originating summons) on the organisation providing\nresidential accommodation to P, the applicant may file a summons to seek\ndispensation of service of such documents on the organisation in question.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"51-consent-of-relevant-persons\">51. Consent of relevant persons</h2>\n\n<p>(1) If any relevant person to be served has consented to the application and to dispensation\nof service, the plaintiff or applicant shall file the consent of the relevant person in Form\n221 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions together with the application. The\nconsent given by the relevant person to the application and to dispensation of service\nmust be attested by a solicitor, a Commissioner for Oaths, a notary public or any person\nfor the time being authorised by law in the place where the document is executed to\nadminister oaths.</p>\n\n<p>(2) The Court may dispense with the service of the application on the relevant person on\nthe application of the plaintiff or applicant. It should be stated clearly in the supporting\naffidavit that such relevant persons have given their consent to the application and to\nthe dispensation of service.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"52-notification-of-p\">52. Notification of P</h2>\n\n<p>(1) In all cases of notification, the person effecting notification must provide P with the\ninformation required under rule 181 of Family Justice Rules in a way that is appropriate\nto P’s circumstances (for example, using simple language, visual aids or any other\nappropriate means).</p>\n\n<p>(2) The certificate of notification filed under rule 181(5) of the Family Justice Rules shall\nbe in Form 223 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions.</p>\n\n<p>(3) Under the Mental Capacity Act, notification of P shall be the norm rather than the\nexception. However, in certain appropriate circumstances, the person required to notify\nP may apply to Court for an order to dispense with the requirement to notify P. Such an\napplication would be appropriate where, for example, P is in a permanent vegetative\nstate or a minimally conscious state, or where notification is likely to cause significant\nand disproportionate distress to P. The reasons for seeking dispensation of notification\nshall be stated in the supporting affidavit of the plaintiff or applicant.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"53-responding-to-an-application\">53. Responding to an application</h2>\n\n<p>(1) If a relevant person served with an application wishes to object to the application or any\npart of it, he must apply to the Court to be joined as a party to the proceedings within\n21 days after the date on which he was served with the application. The application to\nbe joined as a party to the proceedings shall be in Form 4 in Appendix A to these\nPractice Directions and be supported by an affidavit stating his interest in the\napplication and the grounds of his objection.</p>\n\n<p>(2) If a relevant person served with an application consents to the application, his written\nconsent must be attested by a solicitor, a Commissioner for Oaths, a notary public or\nany person for the time being authorised by law in the place where the document is\nexecuted to administer oaths and must be in Form 221 in Appendix A to these Practice\nDirections.

Applications for electronic discovery</h2>\n\n<p>(1) This Part provides an opt-in framework for requests and applications for the giving of\ndiscovery and inspection of electronically stored documents, and the supply of\nelectronic copies of such documents. A party that seeks to rely on this Part must cite the\nrelevant paragraph(s) in any request or application made hereunder.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Location of electronically stored documents</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>(2) Electronically stored documents may reside in storage management systems, folders or\ndirectories in storage locations, electronic media or recording devices, including folders\nor directories where temporarily deleted files are located (for example, the Recycle Bin\nfolder or Trash folder). Electronically stored documents or parts thereof may also reside\nin the unallocated file space or file slack on an electronic medium or recording device\nas deleted files or file fragments which may be recovered through the use of computer\nforensic tools or techniques.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Definition of metadata information</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>(3) Metadata information refers to the non-visible and not readily apparent information\nembedded in or associated with electronically stored documents and may include both\napplication metadata, which is created by the application software used to create the\nelectronic documents, and system metadata, which is created by the operating or storage\nsystem. Examples of application metadata include hidden columns or text, formatting\nand display codes, formulae, prior edits and editorial comments; examples of system\nmetadata include data relating to creation, modification and access of the electronic\ndocument, its size, file format and storage location, and other document profile\ninformation like title, author, subject and keywords or tags. Metadata information may\nbe stored internally within the electronically stored document or externally in a separate\nfile or database. Externally stored metadata information shall be discoverable as\nseparate documents.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Time to consider electronic discovery issues during general discovery</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>(4) Parties are encouraged to collaborate in good faith and agree on issues relating to the\ndiscovery and inspection of electronically stored documents within the framework for\ndiscovery set forth in Part 18 Division 19 of the Family Justice Rules. Such issues may\ninclude the scope and/or any limits on documents to be given in discovery, whether\nparties are prepared to make voluntary disclosures, and the giving of discovery in stages\naccording to an agreed schedule, as well as the format and manner in which copies of\ndiscoverable documents shall be supplied.</p>\n\n<p>(5) Parties may, immediately after the close of pleadings, agree on an electronic discovery\nprotocol which may take the form set forth in Appendix B Part 1. Parties may include\nthe agreed electronic discovery protocol in the summons for directions. The Court shall</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>consider the adequacy of the agreed electronic discovery protocol and may make such\norder or give such direction as it thinks fit, for the just, expeditious and economical\ndisposal of the cause or matter. The agreed electronic discovery protocol, as amended\nby such order or direction of the Court as the case may be, shall form part of the order\nunder the summons for directions to be extracted for the action.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>(6) If parties are unable to agree on an electronic discovery protocol, the party seeking\ndiscovery of electronically stored documents may apply for an order. The application\nmust include a draft electronic discovery protocol and must be supported by affidavit\nproviding an account of the parties’ attempts to collaborate in good faith to reach\nagreement on an electronic discovery protocol.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Requests for discovery</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>(7) A request for discovery of any electronically stored document or class of electronically\nstored documents may be made before the commencement of proceedings, or at any\ntime to any party to a cause or matter, or any person who is not a party to the\nproceedings. Unless the request specifies that discovery of externally stored metadata\ninformation of the requested electronically stored documents is required, the party\nproviding discovery shall not be required to discover externally stored metadata\ninformation.</p>\n\n<p>(8) A class of electronically stored documents may be described by specifying or describing\na search term or phrase to be used in a reasonable search for electronically stored\ndocuments. A request for the giving of discovery by reasonable search must specify or\ndescribe limits on the scope of the search; such limits shall include at least the following:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) specifying or describing physical or logical storage locations, media or devices;\nand\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(b) specifying the period during which the requested electronically stored\ndocuments were created, received or modified.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>(9) A request shall not be made for the discovery of deleted files or file fragments\ncontaining information which may be recovered through the use of computer forensic\ntools or techniques unless:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) a request is made for the discovery of the electronic medium or recording device\non which a forensic inspection is to be conducted; and\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(b) a request is made for inspection of the said electronic medium or recording\ndevice in compliance with sub-paragraph (21) to (27).\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p><strong><em>Applications for discovery</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>(10) An application for discovery of any electronically stored document or class of\nelectronically stored documents which includes externally stored metadata information\nmust be supported by an affidavit showing that a request for externally stored metadata\ninformation of the requested electronically stored document or class of electronically\nstored documents had been made previously.</p>\n\n<p>(11) An application for discovery of any electronically stored document or class of\nelectronically stored documents which specifies or describes a search term or phrase to\nbe used in a reasonable search for electronically stored documents must specify or\ndescribe limits on the scope of the search to be conducted.</p>\n\n<p>(12) An application for the discovery of a computer database, electronic medium or\nrecording device may be made together with an application for inspection of the said\ncomputer database, electronic medium or recording device in accordance with sub-\nparagraph (21) to (27).</p>\n\n<p>(13) Upon the hearing of an application for an order for discovery of electronically stored\ndocuments, the Court shall have regard to the matters set forth in sub-paragraph (15).</p>\n\n<p>(14) Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the party giving discovery from reviewing the\ndiscoverable electronically stored documents or the results of any reasonable search for\nthe purpose of identifying privileged documents. However, such review for the purpose\nof identifying privileged documents shall not extend to the deletion, removal or\nalteration of metadata information.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Matters to which regard shall be had in determining whether discovery or inspection is\nnecessary</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>(15) Rules 468 and 474 of the Family Justice Rules states that an order for discovery and\nproduction of documents for inspection shall not be made unless such order is necessary\neither for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs. The matters to which\nregard shall be had, in determining whether an application for discovery or inspection\n(including the supply of copies) of electronically stored documents is necessary either\nfor disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs, shall include:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) the number of electronic documents involved;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(b) the nature of the case and complexity of the issues;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(c) the value of the claim and the financial position of each party;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(d) the ease and expense of retrieval of any particular electronically stored document\nor class of electronically stored documents, including —\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(i) the accessibility, location and likelihood of locating any relevant\ndocuments,\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(ii) the costs of recovering and giving discovery and inspection of any\nrelevant documents,\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(iii) the likelihood that any relevant documents will be materially altered in\nthe course of recovery, or the giving of discovery or inspection; and\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(e) the significance of any particular electronically stored document or class of\nelectronically stored documents which are likely to be located to the issues in\ndispute.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p><strong><em>Form of list</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>(16) The following matters shall be included in any list of documents made pursuant to the\ngiving of discovery in accordance with this Part in which electronic documents are\nenumerated:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) the name of the electronic file constituting or containing the electronic\ndocument; and\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(b) the file format (and its version) of the electronic document.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>(17) Where the party giving discovery objects to the production of certain discoverable\nelectronically stored documents solely on the ground that the internally stored metadata\ninformation is protected by privilege, he must state in the list of documents whether he\nobjects to the production of the electronic documents without the internally stored\nmetadata information. If he does not object to the production of the electronic\ndocuments without the internally stored metadata information, he must enumerate the\nelectronic documents in Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the list of documents. In any event, he\nmust enumerate such documents in a separate section in Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the list\nof documents and shall state that he objects to the production of the whole or part of the\ninternally stored metadata information of these documents.</p>\n\n<p>(18) Reasonable efforts shall be made to remove duplicated documents from the list of\ndocuments. A document shall be considered a duplicate of another if the contents of\nboth (including metadata information) are identical. The use of a hashing function to\nidentify duplicates shall be deemed to be reasonable effort.</p>\n\n<p>(19) If copies of electronic documents are supplied in one or more read-only optical disc(s)\nor other storage medium, the party giving discovery shall provide a further list, at the\ntime when such copies are supplied, stating the following:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) the storage format (and its version) of the optical disc or storage medium; and\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(b) if there are multiple optical discs or storage media, a list of electronic documents\nstored on each optical disc or storage medium.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>(20) An index of documents enumerated in a list of documents referred to in sub-paragraph\n(16) or (19) above shall be provided in an electronic, text searchable and structured\nformat.

The Court shall have the power to review the adequacy of</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>an inspection protocol and may make such order or give such direction as it thinks fit,\nfor the just, expeditious and economical disposal of the cause or matter.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>(27) Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the party producing computer databases,\nelectronic media or recording devices for inspection from reviewing the discoverable\nelectronically stored documents or the results of any reasonable search for the purpose\nof identifying privileged documents. However, such review for the purpose of\nidentifying privileged documents shall not extend to the deletion, removal or alteration\nof metadata information.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Supply of copies of electronically stored documents</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>(28) Copies of discoverable electronically stored documents shall generally be supplied in\nthe native format in which the requested electronic documents are ordinarily maintained\nand in one or more read-only optical disc(s).</p>\n\n<p>(29) Metadata information internally stored in the native format of discoverable\nelectronically stored documents shall not be deleted, removed or altered without the\nagreement of the parties or an order of Court.

Documents for use in trials</h2>\n\n<p>(1) This Paragraph shall apply to trials of —</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) writ actions; and\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(b) originating summonses ordered to be continued as if the cause of action had been\nbegun by writ.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>(2) Rule 567 of the Family Justice Rules requires the originals of the affidavits of the\nevidence-in-chief of all witnesses and a bundle of documents to be filed not less than 5\nworking days before the trial of an action. This Paragraph prescribes the contents and\nthe format of the bundle of documents. In addition, to improve the conduct of family\nproceedings and to reduce the time taken in the presentation of cases in Court, the\nfollowing documents shall also be prepared by the respective solicitors of the parties:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) a bundle of authorities; and\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(b) an opening statement.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p><strong><em>Documents which need not be filed electronically</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>(3) Paragraphs 88, 89(2) to (6) of these Practice Directions do not apply to the documents\nthat are filed in Court pursuant to the provisions of rule 567(1) of the Family Justice\nRules. Such documents may be tendered to the Registry in hardcopy together with an\nelectronic copy stored on a CD-ROM in PDF format and complying with the provisions\nof this Paragraph.</p>\n\n<p>(4) Any court fees payable, pursuant to Part 19 of the Family Justice Rules, on filing the\ndocuments in this Paragraph, shall be payable at the stamp office. Parties should, when\nmaking payment at the stamp office, indicate to the cashier the precise number of pages\nwhich comprise the documents and comply with the provisions of Paragraph 157 of\nthese Practice Directions.</p>\n\n<p>(5) It is emphasised that payment of the court fees on such documents should be made\nbefore the documents are tendered to Court in compliance with rule 567 of the Family\nJustice Rules. The hardcopy of documents tendered to Court should show, on the front\npage, the amount of court fees paid on the document.</p>\n\n<p>(6) The electronic copy must tally in all respects with the hardcopy, as it will be uploaded\ninto the case file by the Registry staff and will form part of the electronic case file. The\nimportance of not submitting unnecessarily large electronic files is emphasised. To this\nend, parties are to adhere as far as possible to the guidelines set out on the Electronic\nFiling Service website (currently at <a href=\"http://www.elitigation.sg\">http://www.elitigation.sg),</a>,) or its equivalent as may be set</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>up from time to time, on the resolution to be used when scanning documents into PDF\nformat.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>(7) In the event that parties elect to electronically file such documents, they must\nnevertheless tender a bundle of these documents to the Family Registry in hard copy. It\nshall not be necessary to pay any additional court fees in respect of the hard copy in\nsuch circumstances.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Bundle of documents</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>(8) The bundle of documents required to be filed by rule 567 of the Family Justice Rules\nshould be paginated consecutively throughout at the top right hand corner and may be\nprinted on one side or both sides of each page.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) An index of contents of each bundle in the manner and form set out in Form 205\nin Appendix A to these Practice Directions must also be furnished.

The\nscope to which the agreement extends must be stated in the index sheet of the\nagreed bundle.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(c) The documents in the bundles should —\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(i) be firmly secured together with plastic ring binding or plastic spine\nthermal binding, and such rings or spines should be red for plaintiffs and\nblue for defendants with a transparent plastic cover in front and at the\nback;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(ii) have flags to mark out documents to which repeated references will be\nmade in the course of hearing, and such flags shall —\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(A) bear the appropriate indicium by which the document is indicated\nin the index of contents; and\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(B) be spaced out evenly along the right side of the bundle so that as\nfar as possible they do not overlap one another; and\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(iii) be legible (for which purpose clear legible photo-copies of original\ndocuments may be exhibited instead of the originals provided the\noriginals are made available for inspection by the other parties before the\nhearing and by the Judge at the hearing).\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(d) Where originals and copies of documents are included in one bundle, it should\nbe stated in the index which documents are originals and which are copies.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(e) Only documents which are relevant or necessary for the trial shall be included\nin the bundles.

No bundle of authorities is necessary in cases where parties are not relying on\nany authority at the trial. In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs have been\nwasted by the inclusion of unnecessary authorities, the Court will have no hesitation in\nmaking a special order for costs against the relevant person.</p>\n\n<p>(11) The bundle of authorities shall be filed and served on all relevant parties at least 3\nworking days before trial.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Opening statements</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>(12) A proper opening statement is of great assistance to the Court as it sets out the case in a\nnutshell, both as to facts and law. It is intended to identify both for the parties and the\nJudge the issues that are, and are not, in dispute. It enables the Judge to appreciate what\nthe case is about, and what he is to look out for when reading and listening to the\nevidence that will follow. Opening statements also help to clarify issues between the\nparties, so that unnecessary time is not spent on trying to prove what is not disputed or\nirrelevant. The need for brevity is emphasised as opening statements that contain long\nand elaborate arguments, and citations from and references to numerous authorities, do\nnot serve this purpose.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) In the light of these objectives, opening statements will be required in all cases\nfrom all parties, except where dispensation has been granted by the trial Judge\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>and in running down actions.

These issues should be\nnumbered and listed, and each point should be stated in no more than one\nor two sentences. The object here is to identify the issues in dispute and\nstate each party’s position clearly, not to argue or elaborate on them;\n(iii) the principal authorities in support of each legal proposition should be\nlisted, while the key documents and witnesses supporting each factual\nproposition should be identified;\n(iv) where there is a counterclaim or third party action, the opening statement\nmust similarly address all issues raised therein; and\n(v) an explanation of the reliefs claimed (if these are unusual or\ncomplicated).</p>\n\n<p>(c) The plaintiff’s statement as provided for in sub-paragraph (12)(e) below, should,\nunless exempted or dispensation has been granted by the trial Judge, be filed and\nserved on all other relevant parties not less than 3 working days before the\ncommencement of the trial for which they are to be used.</p>\n\n<p>(d) The other counsel should each similarly not later than 2 working days before the\nstart of the trial provide to the Court (with copies at the same time to their\nopponents) a statement which should concisely state the nature of their case on\neach of the issues to be tried and summarise the propositions of law to be\nadvanced with references to the main authorities to be relied on. The character\nand length of this document will depend on the circumstances and whether there\nis any counterclaim or third party proceedings.</p>\n\n<p>(e) In the case of the plaintiff, the statement must include the following:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(i) a summary of essential facts indicating which, if any, are agreed;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(ii) an indication of how these facts are to be proved, identifying relevant\nwitnesses and documents;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(iii) a summary of the issues involved with cross-references as appropriate to\nthe pleadings;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(iv) a summary of the plaintiff’s case in relation to each of the issues with\nreferences to the key documents relied upon, and a summary of the\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>propositions of law to be advanced with references to the main\nauthorities to be relied on; and\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(v) an explanation of the reliefs claimed (if these are unusual or\ncomplicated).\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(f) In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs or hearing days have been\nwasted by a poorly drafted opening statement, the Court will have no hesitation\nin making a special order for costs against the relevant person.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(g) The following format shall be adhered to when preparing opening statements:\n(i) all pages shall be paginated, with the first page (including the cover page)\nnumbered as ‘Page 1’ so that the page numbers of the hard copy\ncorrespond to the page numbers in the Portable Document Format (PDF)\nversion;\n(ii) the minimum font size to be used is Times New Roman 12 or its\nequivalent;\n(iii) the print of every page shall be double spaced;\n(iv) each page may be printed on one side or both sides; and\n(v) every page shall have a margin on all 4 sides, each of at least 35 mm in\nwidth.\n(h) All opening statements should not exceed 20 pages (including all annexes and\nappendices, but excluding the cover page and backing page).\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(i) Counsel will be at liberty to amend their statements at the trial but in such event\nwill be expected to explain the reasons for the amendments.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p><strong><em>Timeline for tendering documents</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>(13) At the trial of the cause or matter, an adjournment may be ordered if:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) the above documents or any of them, save for the opening statement in cases\nwhere it is not required or dispensation was granted, were not filed and served\nwithin the prescribed time or at all; or\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(b) one party seeks to tender any of the above documents or supplements thereto\nexcept for supplements to the opening statement at the trial of the cause or\nmatter.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>(14) If an adjournment is ordered for any of the reasons set out in sub-paragraph (13) above,\nthe party who has failed to file or serve his documents within the prescribed time or at\nall or who seeks to tender a document or supplement thereto except for supplements to\nthe opening statement may be ordered by the Court to bear the costs of the adjournment.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"91-hearing-in-chambers\">91. Hearing in Chambers</h2>\n\n<p>In all hearings in chambers before a Judge or Registrar, counsel shall submit their bundles of\ndocuments and their own bundle of authorities. Rule 567 of the Family Justice Rules and the\nrequirements of Paragraphs 90(8) to (11) shall, with the necessary modifications , be complied\nwith in this regard, save that the bundles may be submitted at the hearing itself before the Judge\nor Registrar, as the case may be.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"92-written-submissions-and-bundles-of-authorities-for-special-date-hearings\">92. Written Submissions and Bundles of Authorities for Special Date Hearings</h2>\n\n<p>This paragraph applies only to hearings in the Family Division of the High Court.</p>\n\n<p>(1) For any contested special date hearing before a Judge in the Family Division of the High\nCourt, each party shall:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) submit to the Court and serve on the other party a hard copy of the following\ndocuments at least 1 clear day in advance of the hearing\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(i) written submissions; and\n(ii) bundle of authorities (which are in compliance with the requirements\nunder paragraphs 88(4), 90(9) to (11) of these Practice Directions); and\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(b) file a soft copy of his written submissions using the Electronic Filing Service no\nlater than 1 working day after the hearing.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>(2) If any party does not intend to rely on written submissions at the contested hearing\nreferred to in sub-paragraph (1) above (e.g., where the hearing does not involve complex\nissues), the party should seek the Court’s approval for a waiver by way of a Request\nusing the Electronic Filing Service at least 7 days before the hearing.</p>\n\n<p>(3) This paragraph does not apply to any hearing before a Judge which is fixed on the\nnormal list.

Citation of written judgments and secondary authorities</h2>\n\n<p><strong><em>Citation of written judgments</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Counsel who cite a judgment must state the proposition of law that the judgment establishes\nand the parts of the judgment that support that proposition. Such statements should not\nexcessively add to the length of the submission but should be sufficient to demonstrate the\nrelevance of that judgment to the argument made. Where counsel wish to cite more than two\njudgments as authority for a given proposition, there must be a compelling reason to do so, and\nthis reason must be provided by counsel in submissions.</p>\n\n<p>Judgments from other jurisdictions can, if judiciously used, provide valuable assistance to the\nCourt. However, where there are in existence local judgments which are directly relevant to the\nissue, such judgments should be cited in precedence to foreign judgments. Relevant local\njudgments will be accorded greater weight than judgments from foreign jurisdictions. This will\nensure that the Courts are not unnecessarily burdened with judgments made in jurisdictions\nwith differing legal, social or economic contexts. In addition, counsel who cite a foreign\njudgment must:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) draw the attention of the Court to any local judgment that may be relevant to\nwhether the Court should accept the proposition that the foreign judgment is said\nto establish; and\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(b) ensure that such citation will be of assistance to the development of local\njurisprudence on the particular issue in question.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>(1) The <strong>neutral citation system</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) A neutral citation is a court-approved system of citation which is independent of\nthe series of law reports or other publications, and unique to each written\njudgment.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(b) Each written judgment from a particular level of court is assigned a sequential\nnumber, starting from 1 at the beginning of each calendar year.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>(2) <strong>Specific paragraph citations</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) Counsel will be required to make specific citations by referring to the paragraph\nnumber of the judgment, and not to the page number of the judgment or report.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(c) For consistency, square brackets will be used to denote paragraph numbers.

As far as possible, counsel should\nrely on primary authorities to support the proposition of law argued for; and</p>\n\n<p>(7) If it necessary to cite secondary authorities, counsel should ensure that the material to\nbe cited is directly relevant to the case before the Court. Counsel are also reminded of\ntheir duty to ensure that such material is not cited out of context. The following are\nspecific guidelines for the citation of different types of secondary authorities:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(a) Textbooks that are generally recognised as leading textbooks in the relevant area\nof law may be readily cited to the Court.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(b) If counsel wish to cite academic articles in journals and periodicals in support\nof a particular proposition of law, they should ensure that they are citing a\nstatement, rather than a critique, of the law. Citation of academic articles should\nbe limited to those written by eminent authors of reputable standing. The\narticles should also have been published in established journals and periodicals.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>(c) Legal opinions written by other counsel not having conduct of the case before\nthe court should generally not be cited as authority. Such legal opinions are\nconsiderably less authoritative than academic articles, as the views expressed in\nthese private opinions have not been subject to the rigorous scrutiny of editorship\nand public critique.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>(8) Counsel’s attention is drawn to rule 859 of the Family Justice Rules which gives the\nCourt the power to make an order for costs personally against errant advocates and\nsolicitors, who have wasted or incurred costs unreasonably or improperly. The Court\nwill not hesitate to invoke its powers under rule 859 of the Family Justice Rules in cases\nwhere costs have been wasted due to counsel’s indiscriminate citation of unnecessary\nand irrelevant secondary authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"94-submissions-and-examination-by-leading-and-assisting-counsel\">94. Submissions and examination by leading and assisting counsel</h2>\n\n<p>(1) In the event that a party is represented by more than one counsel at a hearing, whether\nin Court or in chambers, the making of submissions and the questioning of witnesses\nmay be carried out by one counsel for each party only.</p>\n\n<p>(2) If counsel have divided up their work such that it is necessary or desirable that\nsubmissions on different issues be made or certain portions of the examination, cross-\nexamination or re-examination be conducted by different counsel, an application should\nbe made to Court at the commencement of the trial or hearing for leave to do so.

Further, counsel must not repeat, clarify\nor expand on any submissions or portions thereof that have been made by another\ncounsel for the same party or examine, cross-examine or re-examine witnesses on\nportions of their evidence dealt with by another counsel for the same party.</p>\n\n<p>(4) If leave of the Court is not sought in accordance with sub-paragraph (2), only one\ncounsel will be allowed to make submissions or conduct examination for a party\nthroughout the hearing.</p>\n\n<p>(5) This Paragraph shall apply to all proceedings in the Family Courts, Juvenile Courts and\nFamily Division of the High Court.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"95-amendment-of-documents\">95.

Swearing or affirming of affidavits, statutory declarations and oaths</h2>\n\n<p>(1) Rule 8 of the Commissioners for Oaths Rules (Cap. 322, Rule 3) was amended effective\n1 September 1998 to permit an advocate and solicitor who is appointed a commissioner\nfor oaths to take affidavits or statutory declarations, or administer oaths to a deponent\nin a language or dialect, other than English, spoken or understood by the deponent and\nin which the advocate and solicitor is proficient in. Given these amendments, advocates\nand solicitors are requested to encourage their clients to use the services of other\nadvocates and solicitors who are appointed commissioners for oaths and who are\nproficient in the language or dialect in which the affidavits or statutory declarations are\nto be sworn or affirmed, or in which the oaths are to be taken. The Family Justice Courts’\ncommissioners for oaths will continue to take affidavits or statutory declarations and\nadminister oaths for legally aided cases and for parties who are acting in person who\nneed to file documents in the Family Justice Courts.</p>\n\n<p>(2) If arrangements for the use of the services of advocates and solicitors who are appointed\nas commissioners for oaths are not possible, deponents who are blind or illiterate in\nEnglish may continue to be brought by solicitors to the Family Justice Courts’\ncommissioners for oaths to swear or affirm affidavits and statutory declarations. As the\nFamily Justice Courts’ commissioners for oaths are under a duty to ensure that the\ndeponent understands the document being deposed to, they are obliged to interpret the\ndocument to intended deponents; this is also the case in relation to blind\ndeponents. This necessary exercise may take a considerable time and may cause long\ndelays for other persons who wish to take affidavits or statutory declarations before the\nFamily Justice Courts’ commissioners for oaths.</p>\n\n<p>(3) Accordingly, solicitors who wish to bring illiterate or blind deponents before the Family\nJustice Courts’ commissioners for oaths should first estimate the time that will be taken\nto interpret the document or documents to be deposed to. If it is estimated that the total\ntime required for interpretation of the documents will be more than 20 minutes, the\nsolicitor must write to the Registrar and arrange for a special appointment for the\ndocuments to be sworn or affirmed; the solicitor should not bring the deponent before\nthe duty commissioner for oaths without such an appointment.</p>\n\n<p>(4) If an illiterate or a blind deponent is brought before the duty Family Justice Courts\ncommissioner for oaths and the interpretation of the document or documents takes more\nthan 20 minutes, the commissioner for oaths will refer the solicitor and the deponent to\nthe Registrar for a special appointment to be made for the documents to be deposed to.</p>\n\n<p>(5) Save in exceptional circumstances, the Family Justice Courts will not entertain requests\nfrom advocates and solicitors for its commissioners for oaths to swear or affirm\naffidavits or statutory declarations or administer oaths to a deponent outside the Family\nJustice Courts’ premises. Advocates and solicitors appointed as commissioners for</p>\n\n<p>oaths and who are proficient in the language or dialect in which the affidavits or\nstatutory declarations are to be sworn or affirmed, or in which oaths are to be taken, are\ninstead encouraged to perform this function</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"112-effect-of-non-compliance\">112.

If an adjudication is sought prior to the trial or hearing of the cause or matter,\nthe application for the adjudication will be adjourned to be dealt with at the trial or\nhearing of the cause or matter, and the applicant may be ordered to pay the costs of the\nadjournment.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"114-draft-orders-of-court\">114.
